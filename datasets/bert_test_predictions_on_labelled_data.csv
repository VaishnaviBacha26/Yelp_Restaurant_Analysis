0,"Love the ""CHEERS""  everybody knows your name type feel you get when first walking in, but it seemed that you had to be a regular in order to get quality service.  I'll admit, they do have some unique, creative meals thrown together like the Bacon Popcorn and a good variety of items to choose from. We tried the Handcut Fries, which comes with an assortment of dipping sauce (wasn't to fond of, couldn't taste a difference), the Shrimp Po' Boy (basic ingredients but very tasty!) and the Gumbo (a little bland).  Overall the food was mediocre, if I lived a little closer I could see myself returning to visit the bar and maybe try the burgers.  They also do have a couple of flat screens setup around the bar to catch the game.",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,3,2,0,0,0,3
1,We found this place while trying to eat at the Rum house next door and decided we didn't want to wait 45 minutes for a table. So glad we did. It was hard to choose from the menu because everything sounded so good. I ended up with the salmon and it was perfect. The cherry bread pudding was pretty yummy as well.,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,5.0,0,5,0,3,0,5
2,"Not our first time at this long time, well known location, previously The Striped Bass, but first time to Butcher and Singer.  Still truly a special decor to enjoy a delicious dinner. Surprised it wasn't busier for a Friday night, but still somewhat early, 7:00. From start to finish, we couldn't have been more satisfied. Without a reservation, the hostess happily greeted us and we were seated immediately. Awesome and efficient service. Two steaks could not have been better. Although a lot of competition in the city for steak houses. For embiance, service and great food this is hard to beat.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,5,5,0,0,0
3,Went in last night it was the first time we have been in since the renovations and it looks great! Our server was very sweet and attentive. Food took a little long but we ordered a lot of food so I'm not going to take a star off for that! The best thing is I left my receipt and needed it for a budget and the bartender personally sent me my receipt while I was on the phone with her after she tracked down where we sat and who took care of us. I'll come back repeatedly for this reason. Thanks ladies for doing such a great job!,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,5,5,0,5,0,0
4,"In all fairness, this place is good for a certain kind of diner and customer. If you like a party, a loud atmosphere and drinking--you will probably rate it much higher. That said, the food wasn't great. Again, if you like heavy, greasy, deep fried food--you may like it more. I went with spouse and a friend on a night when the place was hosting a live talk-radio show. It was insanely loud, and very dark. The waitress had to bend down so she could be heard. I don't get what's so wonderful about not being able to talk because a restaurant is SO loud. Anyway, the cornbread was good. The hush puppies were overcooked, the jambalaya was serviceable, and my salad had sand (or sandy dirt) in it. There was nothing relaxing or satisfying about the experience. If you dislike loud restaurants and overrated food (especially if you are from the Louisiana area) avoid this place. Why it is has such high ratings is a bit of a mystery but I suspect it's the type of cuisine and bar scene combined...plus there aren't many (or any?) other Cajun options in Tucson. Maybe we just went on a bad night in the kitchen, exacerbated by coerced listening to talk radio.",2.0,0.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0,2,2,0,0,0
5,"Oh scratch biscuits.. We tried this relationship out twice and twice you've betrayed me. We came when you first opened and the food was good! But there was serious issues with your workflow. We attributed that to growing pains.

We return today to find exceptionally dry biscuits, topped with extra dry and under-seasoned brisket. I'll give you the one star for the fried chicken. The fried chicken was good, but again, the biscuit made it tough to eat. We also ordered the ""demolished"" yam fries. I can't believe we spent an extra $3 for a small dollop of pimento cheese. 

I was really looking forward to your banana pudding but there wasn't any available.

Even though there's not much seating in the front, I ended up at a table both times and the waitress that served us was very friendly and fast. The DJ was good enough and kept our crowd moving and the night going. The crowd is definitely college-aged, but nothing seems too rowdy ever (aka it doesn't seem like a frat party). I'd recommend it.",4.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4,5,4,0,0,0
7,"Ok, I admit...I got really excited to go here after seeing it on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives.  Seeing the show was actually a blessing, because I would have never ordered cheesesteak empanadas had I not seen how awesome they were.  What really makes them amazing is the flying fish sauce that comes with.  Heaven.

After watching several amazing-looking Good Dog burgers come out of the kitchen, I finally decided to try one.  I was so disappointed!  The burger was really really dry and did not live up to my expectations at all.  So sad.

The menu does look really interesting and I would definitely go back to try more things.   Something good/intriguing about a place that's dark inside 24 hrs a day with at least a few people posted up at the bar by 11:00am...with dog photos all over the walls...and a simultaneous tattooed hipster vibe...",3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0,5,4,0,0,4
8,"I usually don't review chain restaurants but I've been curious about Joe's Crab Shack after seeing countless commercials on TV so I was a bit excited to try it out.  I LOVE seafood & sometimes I make the journey from Philly to DC just for some good crabs so I ventured into Joe's not knowing what to expect.

The wait is long!  It seems to always be crowded there - they text you when your table is ready.  I do think they need to reconsider their brand image bc their decor just seemed off to me.  When you walk in, it has a big open fish market feel w/ cafeteria style seating but then a moderately fancy bar?  ehh I dont get it.

Waiter -- super friendly.  He suggested their sampler appetizer which mehh I don't recommend.  Crab dip, crab jalapeno poppers, & calamari -- not impressive.  Joe's offers individual steamed pots full of an assortment of crabs, lobsters, clams, mussels etc depending on which one you choose.  They look huge on the menu but I suppose in the good old American way -- one person can def devour one if they were hungry.  

The 2 of us ordered the Sam Adams & Diablo pot.  Sam Adams -- too salty but the Diablo - nom nom good!  It's quite satisfying to have this giant pot full of steaming good seafood in front of you.

9,"I decided to go to this place for lunch after reading so many rave reviews. I'm not sure if it was what they were serving that day, or if it's just me, but I was very disappointed!!! The fried chicken was very good, but the sides and desserts were bland, and reminded me of a cafeteria for geriatrics. The guy that runs the place is Italian, so I would expect a lot more flavor! The mac n cheese was watery (didn't eat it at all), the green beans were ok, and the mashed potatoes and gravy were pretty good. Everything needed salt and pepper, which I don't normally add extra to anything. The rolls that they serve are delicious, and the fruit tea is on point!!! I think the meat and drinks are good, but the sides could use some improvements. I will definitely visit this place again to see if I just hit it on a bad day. :)",3.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,2,0,0,0,0
10,"This place was fantastic.

We went because my husband was craving a burger, and I wanted to try a local, non-chain restaurant.  What a wonderful surprise!

The best part of the place was the amazing service we received.  Our waiter was constantly checking on us (in a non-obnoxious way) and refilling drinks.  More impressively, the owner came to our table multiple times, remembered our names, and even comped us dessert.

I had the fried pork chop sandwich, and it was wonderful.  I went with the super spicy sauce, which had the right amount of kick for me.  Apparently most people find it too spicy, so even after the waiter insisted that I order the sauce on the side, the owner came out to make sure that I didn't want to switch to the normal spicy sauce.  Whatever.  Oh, the fries were perfectly crisp, and I loved the spices.

My husband had his cheeseburger, and he enjoyed it.  He had a cup of chili instead of fries, and he said that he'd happily order it again.

As I mentioned above, dessert was on the house.  The owner insisted that we try the orangesicle cheesecake, which tasted very orange-y and rich.  It was great (if you love oranges -- and I do), but next time, I want to try the neapolitan cheesecake.

The homemade chips and ranch dip were phenomenally simple yet tasty.  I'd go back to EATS again just for the chips and a beer.  But, of course, then I'd want the cheesecake.  And a fried pork sandwich.  

Oh, be forewarned: on Tuesdays, kids eat free, so Tuesdays are crowded with kids.  That might or might not be a positive in your book.",5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,5,5,0,0,0,0

The coffee is good (roasted in house), the food- great  , the staff helpful (they show you how to slow drip your own coffee), alas, there is a ""limit"" to how long they let you use their wi-fi. My main reason for going to coffee shops? To work. I was almost finished with a blog post and the Internet was disconnected. All my work- gone. The barista told me there was nothing he could do, there was an automatic limit for the wifi password to prevent people from sitting there all day without buying anything. I bought coffee AND food, and I was about to buy more coffee!!!! Now I'm leaving, and I won't return. What's the point? And it's not like the place was packed. There was hardly anyone in there.

I'm pretty sure that if the food wasn't good people wouldn't be waiting an hour or more to get a seat. No matter what location you go to your gonna have a wait especially in the KOP mall because of its popularity. 
Personal favorites would be the Shepard's pie, chicken and biscuits, factory nachos with spicy chicken and the pork tenderloin! Desert favorites are the Original cheese cake with strawberry's and the Chocolate Truffle cake. Both are to die for.

20,"I'm always raving or talking about this place. So, one of my friends who had never been with me made reservations.

We sat inside, because it was quite humid out. Our host/waiter gave us the option of outside, inside, upstairs.

One of the things I love about eating out is bread and butter. Because really how often do you eat bread and butter at home?

We shared the pate maison, which if you love pate like me it could easily be a dinner in itself. It comes with cornichons and toasted baguette, because you really can't have pate without cornichons. It's like apple pie without ice cream. The waiter and I gushed about the pate he told me he had it for dinner!

Next the fresh crab salad. Luscious lumps of crab and grapefruit dotted the salad. It was divine. It's a seasonal salad so go quick!

We shared an order of the Chicken Dijon which I have been eating there for years. I love the perfectly cooked chicken and the amazing mustard sauce. I could eat it once a week and never tire of it! What was great is that they sent it out on two plates since we were sharing! They served it with mashed potatoes and the most wonderfully cooked mustard or collard greens. Yum

Their desserts are all made in house. She had the chocolate mousse pie, (which is great to know they make since White Dog is now owned by Moshulu and I refuse to go there!) which was rich and lovely and too big to finish. I had the creme brulee....i love creme brulee and order it wherever I go.

We also had a couple cocktails that were terrific (unique and well made). We sat at the bar and both bartenders were very helpful and attentive. The atmosphere, decor, service and food are all top notch.

25,"Our spring vacation last year was to Nashville Tennessee where I got to try some of the local, authentic favorites for Nashville Hot Chicken. Since I always put tabasco or some kind of hot sauce on fried chicken anyway, I was in love with the idea as soon as I heard about it.

While there are plenty of places around Indy that serve great fried chicken, I usually have to bring my own hot sauce with me. So I was really excited to hear that we're getting our own branch of a proper southern chain. And Joella's Indy location didn't disappoint.

Of course, the main interest is the hot chicken. While not quite as flavorful as Hattie B's in Nashville, it was darn good. I got the ""Hot"" level, and even my well-seasoned palette could feel some burn. If you're not into spice, keep the heat level low. But I love spice and was pleasantly surprised to find that the Hot was actually hot. And the chicken itself was juicy and well fried.

The garlic parm fries were a little weaker. They're about the size of cut of Steak N Shake fries with big chunks of parm sprinkled on top. Good but not amazing. The vinegar slaw was pretty tasty, though, and I'm looking forward to taking my southern wife with me to see what she thinks.

Wait time wasn't bad at all for me--not for fresh made chicken. The staff were well organized and got my food right out to me. I was really happy with the service I received.

If you want some real spice and good chicken, I'd give Joella's a try. It's not quite up there with the best of the best in Nashville, but it's darn good!",5.0,0.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0,4,0,0,0,0

29,"My oldest daughter treated us to a lovely dinner here last week.  I have to say, I thought it was definitely NOT average.  By the time I had wolfed down a couple pieces of their awesome caramelized onion and rosemary bread with a yummy cheesy garlic olive oil dip, and my ""Not Your Average House Salad"" - (an absolutely wonderful salad with roasted tomatoes, blue cheese and a tangy lemon dressing), I was sold.  At that point, I had decided that Joe's was gonna be the kind of place where I would have a hard time not licking my plate!

My entrée - the Cranberry-Teriyaki Statler Chicken (pan-roasted chicken with house-made butternut squash ricotta cannelloni and sautéed spinach) - was very good, although the chicken was a bit dry but the tasty sauce made up for that.  The cannelloni was delicious and perfectly cooked, not to mention filling.  The spinach - well, it was good but there wasn't a whole lot of it.  I love spinach so I could have used more of that on the plate.  Overall though - an A+.  My family enjoyed their entrees as well - Sirloin Tips, Sage Pecan Salmon, Chicken Piccata, Spaghetti Squash Bolognese).

The service was good although we did wait quite a while for entrees, but I'm pretty sure that wasn't our waiter's fault, and the second basket of bread helped hold us off.  

Would love to go back soon just to have that bread and salad again and try out some of their appetizers.  Will have to start working on the hubby for that.  It's a bit on the pricey side for us, so I am gonna have to do some sweet-talking for sure.

We all ordered the mimosa bar to celebrate my friend's bachelorette party and that was super cute. We also each ordered our own entrees: shrimp and grits, hangover bowl, artichoke dip, boudin biscuit, the chicken and biscuit and the croque madame toast. The portions were huge and the food was definitely filling. The flavor was good, but after multiple bites, the shrimp and grits, artichoke dip and hangover bowl became too salty and the toast was a bit bland. The boudin and biscuit was a good flavor and filling so my friend wasn't able to finish that and had to ask for to-go. 

Service was not the greatest. The hostess was not friendly when we checked in and our waiter seemed exasperated with us whenever we asked for something and wasn't friendly at all.

It seems like this particular place has several regulars, but we didn't have trouble finding a table at peak dining hours around 6-7pm.

The food came out really quickly, and we began with their spinach and artichoke dip.

I ordered the gastroburger which has caramelized onions, queso, provolone, and a garlic aioli. It was delicious but extremely heavy. I also don't think the kitchen cooked the burger as I specified, but the well done burger I had was still pretty good.

I love smoked salmon and decided to get the smoked salmon avocado toast on the lighter/sensible fare part of the menu. I've had smoked salmon toast at many other restaurants in the city and have been delighted every time, but this one was awful (and I'm not a picky eater). The bread was soggy, not toasted properly. The ""avocado"" was just premade guacamole spread on top of the soggy bread. The salmon and capers were on the side, as well as a boiled egg and pickled red onions (I prefer fresh red onion on my avocado toast). The salmon was okay. The pickled onions were not good. I managed two bites before giving up completely- it was that bad. To their credit, the restaurant did take it off my bill, but the dish needs some serious revamping. Also, a note about the layout of the restaurant- in order to order a drink at the bar while waiting, they have you go into the corner of the bar where the servers' computer is also located, as well as silverware, etc, so while waiting for a drink you end up having to shift and rearrange and move every five seconds to accommodate everyone in the space. The bartender was also unusually slow and didn't pay much attention to the people waiting to get their drinks at the end of the bar. I'll probably skip this restaurant next time and go to Ruby Slipper, where the food is always delicious and the service is great.",3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,2,0,0,0,3

""Great food can save bad service but bad service can't save great food""

After my experience at The Pharmacy, this could not be more true!  Before we get into the details, let me begin by saying, this is a really cool place.  They did a fantastic job with the design and the beer garden is unbelievable.  Great concept that was well executed.

Our party of 11 sat for over 20mins chatting while waiting for a server to approach us to take drink orders. Not a great start.....  Once we finally placed our drink (and food, since we had so much time to look over the menu) orders, the drinks SLOWLY came out.  In all seriousness it had been over 40mins from the time we sat down until the first couple of beers hit the table.  And that is the best part, nothing came out in any sequence.  Literally, 1 and 2 at a time even though all the orders were placed at the same time.  This continued all night, to the point that several of us opened tabs at the bar as well because you were more likely to hit the Powerball than get a drink in less than 30mins.  

The food was great, but please refer to the quote above.  The service was so laughably poor that the great burgers were lost in the shuffle.  Some serious work needs to be done in the FOH service model here.  What a shame.",2.0,2.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0,5,0,3,0,0

Local beers and assorted 5 dollar well drinks.

Ordered a few of the HH appetizers and things went down hill. Portions were minuscule like two or three bites tops def not possible to share.

To top it off service slowed considerably because of computer issues--not bar staffs fault at all--but still annoying.

48,"Because of COVID, I'm going to update my review with some current notes. First, let me say that this is still my favorite beach bar restaurant in the Tampa Bay area. My experience last Friday night was hopefully not indicative of normal service going forward. That aside, all staff wore masks & social distancing was evident.

We arrived on Friday evening, 09/25/2020, around 5:30pm. I was disappointed to see they now have parking meters, instead of a guy collecting $10 to park & giving a coupon to be applied toward food & drinks at Caddy's. Also the meter was a bit confusing so we ended up only paying for an hour, thinking we'd just come back & add more money later. After walking in, the hostess offered to seat us inside downstairs. Hubs asked if the upstairs bar area was open - the hostess advised that it was, and we could seat ourselves. 

We went upstairs & realized the slowly setting sun was rather blinding so we found seats straddling a far corner of the bar, quite a distance away from the other groups clustered around the large square bar. Almost immediately, the bartender came over & admonished us about something, though I couldn't quite hear her above the crowd noise & music. Some of the words I heard: she didn't want us to get in trouble, she'd been a bartender for 18 years, and she asked for our drink order. So we kept our masks on until our drinks arrived, because we weren't sure what she'd yelled at us & she hadn't pointed or given any other non-verbal clues. 

Several minutes later, she asked if we wanted anything else so hubs asked if we could get food there or if we had to go downstairs. She said we could get food, so we ordered the grouper nuggets appetizer to split. After our food came, and we'd been eating for a few minutes, she came over & told us that she had gotten in trouble for us eating at the bar and we had to move away from the bar. So we slid our bar stools back just far enough that we could still reach the bar, since we were still eating & drinking. Right about then, the couple on hubs' side, about 8-10 feet away, had left, and the same bartender waved over to a couple of guys that the spot was open & they could move there. Then they ordered some food. Right after the food arrived, she yelled at them about eating at the bar. One of the guys asked to speak to the manager - she pointed across the deck, and he went over to talk to him. Then he came back & continued to eat his food, without moving his stool. A few minutes later, she told us we weren't supposed to be eating at the bar and reiterated that she'd gotten in trouble. We were so confused at that point, and felt very unwelcome, so we asked for a to-go box & our check, and just left. Side note: the women's bathroom smelled horribly, and I informed the manager on our way out.

I've been to Caddy's so many times over the last 30 years that this one experience will not affect my likelihood of visiting again. However, it was uncomfortable enough that I want to warn my fellow Yelpers. Also, it was my birthday, which we never had a chance to mention in any context, but will be memorable. I still don't know if the bartender was having a bad afternoon, or if Caddy's has some rule(s) in place regarding congregating and/or eating around the upstairs bar. The square bar was huge, maybe 20 feet on each side, with at least 7 separate small groups around the bar, all adequately distanced. Our corner was empty, AND IN THE CORNER, 8+ feet away from any other person, so I'm not sure what we did wrong, if anything, but the whole hour there was simply weird and I regretted not sitting downstairs at a table.

59,"I've always been a fan of Emeril (he grew up in the same town as my parents!), and we were excited to try one of his restaurants while in New Orleans. Sadly, NOLA was very disappointing. I got the roasted oysters to start, which didn't have a great flavor - I didn't even finish them all, and there were only five on the plate. For the main (which took ages to come out of the kitchen), I had the ""famous"" fried chicken, which was a big let-down. The crust was light and had a nice flavor, but flaked off the second I cut into it, and the chicken underneath was either not cooked well or just not good quality chicken. It came with a side of mac & cheese, which you normally can't go wrong with, but these were overly cheesy/creamy/rich, and I could only eat a couple bites. We didn't even bother getting dessert.

The service at NOLA was also slow and impersonal. It felt like they were just going through the motions at a large restaurant. I would highly recommend skipping this place and going to one of the many other great restaurants in New Orleans instead (like Brennan's, where we'd had an amazing meal the night before!).

I ordered what I consider to be the most important meats in true BBQ: pulled pork, brisket, and ribs. I also got their Mac and Cheese, ""famous"" mixed bean baked beans, and their corn bread muffins. Let's start with the brisket, bland with no visible smoke ring. It tasted more like it was roasted in the oven with liquid smoke added in. The pulled pork was decent but nothing to write home about. Again needs more smoke flavor. The ribs were the best part of the meal. The rub was good and flavorful, they fell apart nicely and had a decent smokey flavor. The mac n cheese seemed a bit Kraft Mac and Cheeseish with bigger noodles. The baked beans were good but seemed like they were just Bush's baked beans with some pulled pork thrown in for good measure and authenticity. By far the star of the sides was the corn bread muffins, they were great. 66 dollars later and I'm feeling a bit underwhelmed with the meal I got. Now I'm no Myron Mixon but I have been a sous chef for the last 18 years and focusing on southern BBQ for the last 12 years. I personally like my BBQ with a heavy smoke flavor and deep smoke ring penetration. This is hard to find in a restaurant but my search will continue till I do. Overall I give this place a 2 star rating due to the lack of smokey flavor in their food and seemingly inability to create truly flavorful original recipe sides. Opening a can of food distributor baked beans and pouring them in a pot and heating them or just mixing cheddar cheese and noodles and calling it Mac n Cheese is just unacceptable to me for a place claiming that they are a true BBQ place. BBQ is food of the soul and should be treated that way, created that way, and served that way.",2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0,2,0,0,1,0

We arrived here a few minutes to 11 a.m. (when they open), and unfortunately, the hostess was pretty bitchy about letting the line of people waiting to get in know that it wasn't happening until 11 a.m. She just had an attitude about the situation which was in stark contrast to all the incredible service we received during our time in NOLA. We had made a reservation about a week prior for brunch, and as soon as they opened their doors we got a great seat in the courtyard. Gotta say, the metal seats are super uncomfortable, but the atmosphere is really nice and relaxing. We ordered fig preserves, goat cheese, fruit and nut bread. It was out of this world. We also got the jumbo shrimp and grits. So, so dope. Tomato and mozz salad was okay. Only thing that we didn't like was the creamed spinach and artichoke with oysters. It looked and tasted gross.

81,"Was very excited to try this place out.  Came here early on a Sunday and was told that due to 2 weddings and an evening event, no parking was available.  SHAME on you Bongo's.  Despite seeing a ton of parking, we were told we had to park elsewhere. 

While I totally get having weddings, offer a shuttle for the passengers.  Why would you operate restaurants on a property that's also sharing parking with other special events?  Why is it ok to inconvenience restaurant patrons because you have a wedding?  Or, offer no solution other than ""find parking elsewhere but spend your money here!""

The lot attendant told us we could try to find metered parking nearby in the lot (good luck - weekend near the beach?) and honestly I wasn't going to drive around, when there were tons of free spaces right here, to then patronize a restaurant that clearly isn't concerned about inconveniencing their customers.  

I loved the idea of a live band and average bar food and having some drinks, but it wasn't meant to be.  

Bottom line: Won't return.  Too many other places to go and not worth a parking hassle to spend my money here.  Shame on the owners for not taking better care of their customers and valuing one customer over another.  Horrible business plan.  

Read the reviews.  You're losing customers and you lost one more.  Will they care that I don't return?  No, but then again, I won't lose sleep that I won't be back either.  But I do believe people have a right to know how they'll likely be treated.",1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,0,1,0,0,0

I was surprised to see that the burgers are decently priced and have a lot of varieties that I can't wait to try. My first time in, I decided to keep it basic with a cheeseburger.

The burger is perfectly cooked to your liking and very well seasoned. the bread adds a warm, soft, yummyness to hold it all together.

My brother and girlfriend arrived first and were told that they couldn't sit at our table until at least half of the party was there. They were told they could go to the bar to wait. That seemed a little strange to me, but I figured each place has different policies about large groups. When we were finally seated at our table, two chairs were flimsy plastic fold-out chairs that sat much lower to the ground than the other chairs, making the table seem too high for me to eat comfortably. This was really odd and when the table behind us left, I switched the chairs out so we could all be eye-level. 
When we sat down we were told that the bread was in the oven, and we would be served as soon as it came out. 15 minutes later, my brother asked our server if the bread was almost done, and after another 5 minutes, a large pan was brought out and cut. We were given HUGE portions of bread right away and it was delicious. There was olive oil on the table so some of us drizzled some over our fresh bread. Nice touch! 
I ordered the beet salad with salmon. The salmon was VERY salty but cooked perfectly. I asked for the salad dressing on the side, but was on my salad when I received it instead. Others in my group got the veal, penne vodka, spaghetti and meatballs, and ravioli. The meatballs were homemade and delicious! My mom ended up getting cannoli for dessert and they were fresh and crunchy! Our waitress was very helpful and pleasant.

The ambience and Decour were beautiful but that's where it pretty much ended.we were seated by the waiting area which felt a little odd .. Hungry people watching you eat...we ordered the Carolina fried deviled eggs as an appetizer when they came out they were warm at best we weren't sure if they were supposed to be like that so we didn't think too much. We were seated to where we could see in the kitchen and I noticed that there were two dishes sitting in the window that weren't being taken out but all the other entrées were.I was thinking in the back of my head please don't let that be our food still sitting in the window. And sure enough it was 18 minutes later our food that was sitting in the window came out.I had ordered Baja fish tacos they were extremely cold covered and the heaping pile of guacamole and avocado was runny. The fries that came with them tasted like they were a day old and reheated.my fiancé got the fried bologna sandwich and macaroni and cheese.The Mac & cheese was okay but the fried bologna sandwich was also cold to the point where we couldn't even finish it. Now I know some of you are probably reading this saying why when you just send it back... well the both of us have worked in the restaurant industry when we were in college and it's just a rule that you don't send food back. The line cook was not wearing gloves and was touching all of the food while wiping the sweat off of his head. most of the cooks seem to have duck dynasty beards and those were not covered. But aside from the food what bothered me was as a new restaurant and designing a restaurant you would think that there would be more than one server station we noticed that there was only one server station and multiple servers were waiting in line to put in their customers orders.it wasn't all that busy when we were there and we noticed that the server station is right by the hallway where they take out the food to the customer so the servers were bumping into other servers pretty regularly.

The kimchi was good and gave a nice tart spicy kick to it, but I'm not sure about the execution of the taco itself. It was messy. Kimchi is a messy and very wet food.

First introduced a few years back when I met my best friend for breakfast, yes I said it breakfast!? They serve the breakfast until 12 P.M. during the week and brunch until 2 P.M. Sundays. 

They offer generous portions at a great value. My last visit was yesterday morning picking up my to go order. Corn beef hash stacker is my go to for breakfast and is always a treat! This particular dish is corn beef hash on top of their home fries, (these potatoes have bacon bits and are so heavenly) served with two poached eggs on top and hollandaise sauce and your choice of a side of toast or biscuit. I always ask for the hollandaise on the side as it can be on the heavier side if its smothered in sauce. This is available in the half order and full order. See my pic I posted a few weeks ago, I am just a little late on this review. Oh and if you like cinnamon rolls, try it at breakfast and they always go quickly so do ask your server upon arrival to ensure you'll get one. I promise you won't be disappointed! Served hot with caramel sauce and topped off with candied pecans. I meant to take a picture when I had it last Sunday, but it didn't make it five minutes! Lol
 
As far as lunch or dinner here, I have had their pulled pork, beef ribs, meat platters with dirty rice and cheddar grits as my favorite sides well and their delicious corn bread. They are famous for their ""kick-ass"" fries. I have had them for breakfast when I was pregnant with my daughter quite frequently, so good! Start a stamp card if you think you'll be like me and have them once every two weeks. 
 I'll never forget the first time I tried their beef ribs and beef brisket, the meat was so juicy and tender it melted in my mouth. The smoked flavor is a memory embedded in my taste buds, so good it keeps me coming back!  Say yes to their hot sauce, I usually will have the hot BBQ sauce then top it off with their hot sauce. This place is one of my all time favorites ever and I always recommend it to tourists in our casino when they ask me where I like to go to breakfast and lunch.

Walked right in on a Friday night.  There was a healthy crowd but zero wait my party of two was seated right away.  Our friendly waiter appeared right away to get our drink orders. We both ordered the stuffed chicken breast...comes with mashed potatoes and an additional side. 
I asked our waiter how the garlic green beans were...you know they can be crisp or yuck and mushy.  Loved his honest opinion of, they are one step above the asparagus...but the face he gave said it all.  Now you might think, shame on him for dissing an item but hey...I asked and he was honest. Right there bonus points for him. I ordered double mashed potatoes and my daughter ordered sweet potato fries (boy, were they good - salty not sweet). 
Food came out hot and delicious. No way could I eat the second generous portion of mashed potatoes. 
Time for the bill.  Our area was packed at this point and I thought we would wait and wait.  WRONG. Our ticket was delivered, card run through and signed in a more tha reasonable amount of time. 
Did I just have a great waiter?  Maybe.  But I let him know his value with my tip and enjoyed dinner.

Tip:  Don't waste your $5.95 on the new apple dessert with ice cream and caramel drizzle.  It's not served hot so not worth ordering. 

Update:  Five people at my table.  All ordered stuffed chicken breast.  Two orders had golden fried chicken.  Three orders were somewhat black and burned looking on both sides and breading around all sides was light/not fried looking.

When he greeted us ""Welcome to Zaxbys home of the best chicken sandwich"". My nephew and I looked at each other skeptically. We had ate many other chicken sandwiches. Some were good and only one tickled our fancy. The young man at the drive thru sounded very confident. He gave us what I refer to as the "" The business "". If I could gave him a six star rating I would have. This guy will crack you up. We got to the window and picked up our order. Same guy waits on us. He continues to his hysterical spiel till we drive off. Now for the ""CHICKEN SANDWICH"". Unwrapping the sandwich the first thing I noticed is the size of the chicken breast Zaxbys gives you. Bring your fat pants with you because by the time you finish they will be necessary. Biting into the sandwich, it's well seasoned and has a light crunchy texture ( must be from the double breading). You had me at double breading. When I find a stellar chicken sandwich it's like an Al Green song just sit back and enjoy it.

Unfortunately upon arrival we were told they were running behind on the reservations and there would be a 15 minute wait.  No problem!  We had plenty of our own delicious wine to drink in the meantime.  The 15 minutes became an hour.  Then they gave our table to another party that came in 15 minutes after we did and had a later reservation.  Still, we were in good spirits after clearing that problem up.

The meal turned out to be a bigger problem.   I love goat cheese and smoked salmon, yet somehow my appetizer was almost inedible.  Others in my party loved their apps and I have to admit the tortellini were very good.   The NY strip steak dishes were a huge ripoff (super small portion of meat)  The saving grace was the scallop dish.  If all I had was this dish, I would probably give the place 5 stars.  Dessert was pretty much a disaster.

I also got 2 fried Oreos (at a $1 each) and they were a-mazing! The reason I am giving this review 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the limited parking that's available. And because there was no kind of direction when I first walked in. I wasn't greeted by anyone and there was no sign that said seat yourself, so I was wandering around until I finally asked a guest, ""Do we seat ourselves?""

272,"Before writing this review I researched the menu online because we were given a pancake we didn't order and it confused me a lot when it arrived. The server told us it came with the meal. I think that may have been a mistake.

On Tuesday 2.2.21 my husband and I chose Black Bear Diner for our weekly breakfast/lunch date. I had smelled KFC about 10 minutes prior when I dropped my car off nearby and it made me want Chicken and Waffles. I just wanted to dip my fried chicken in warm syrup, that was all I could think about. We saw Black Bear and I knew they had what I wanted.

We called ahead to see the reservation situation. They do not take phone reservations, it is first come first serve. After we arrived we gave our phone number to the host and she let us know it would be 10 to 15 minutes. We waited in our car and it was about 10 minutes before we received the text to come inside. This was around 10am.

We were seated in the center of the restaurant. There was a lot of space between the tables and everyone was wearing a mask. We ordered coffee and water and waited patiently for the server to take our food order. Our server asked if I wanted cream and sugar with my coffee and I told her I didn't but she brought it anyway. I thought that was kinda funny. 

Since I already knew what I wanted I just had to wait for hubby to decide. Of course I ordered the Chicken and Waffles which comes with: A sweet cream waffle, 3 chicken strips,  2 eggs (any style), fresh fruit and syrup. I did not receive fruit save for the slice of orange garnish but I didn't know this was supposed to come with my food until today while researching the pancake. So no fruit, extra pancake. 

That was the best waffle! I don't normally get waffles because of the texture but this waffle recipe is by far my favorite. It's creamy and slightly sweet and it was evenly cooked and it had an adorable bear paw in the center. My eggs were cooked correctly. I asked for them to be on a separate plate and they obliged. I did not have leftovers. (Besides the extra pancake)

My husband ordered Bear's Choice (It's a BYO deal) with: bacon, a waffle, and scrambled eggs. Since we both ordered waffles I did not need to try his. I did get to snag a bite of bacon though. They have really good bacon. I didn't want to return his piece to him but I did because I'm nice.

Our visit was pleasant overall. We didn't use the facilities because there is an off odor coming from that section so we avoided that area. My coffee cup was never empty and we received our bill in a reasonable amount of time. 

I will return to this location for sure. I probably come here as often as I go to the one in Auburn. (Twice a year) Both locations are great!",4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2,3,0,2,0,0

I was in the mood for a beer, but was severely disappointed by the lack of beers on draft (only 3? really?). I ended up ordering a Cigar City Maduro in the bottle. 

We were seated after roughly 45 minutes and were escorted to our table in the loft-ish area upstairs.

The menu was amazing. I actually had a sneak peek at the kitchen as we were waiting to be seated and everything that passed by looked and smelled good. My stomach was grumbling and I was ready for food!

I ordered the Wino Burger, which was AMAZING. Definitely worth ordering again if I had the chance. The ""bacon apple jam"" on top? Umm.. yeah. Mouthwatering. Totally made the burger. Can I have more now, please? pretty please?

The sweet potato fries may or may not have been why I stuck with the burger page. I saw too many of these puppies pass me by - I had to try them. The fries were salty, not sweet, which I 100% prefer. I'm not a huge fan of sweetened sweet potato fries. These were more herby and spicy. They were perfect with ketchup.

The girls ordered a banana/ peanut butter/ chocolate churro with ice cream dish for dessert that looked and sounded delicious. If it didn't have banana, I would have been all over it.

Overall I was impressed with Ellas and can see why it's so popular - it totally met and surpassed all my expectations. My new goal is to return for their Soul Food Sundays!",4.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0,5,4,3,0,5

305,"This Tavern is not a restaurant. It is a ""concept."" It is one of many eateries collected under the M Street Entertainment Group, which across their portfolio of concepts offers a wide range of cuisines: a boutique steakhouse, a Latin cantina, an Asian fusion lounge, Italian kitchens, and a couple of Southern American pubs. Tavern falls into this last category as a gastro-pub, but if you ask me, from the inside, it appears to be a dungeon.

The lobby contains decorative chains, gears, and possibly even a functioning drawbridge door. The interior is dark, no matter what time of day you're eating, and there's clean wood, stone, and concrete material surrounding you. The upper eating deck, which looks down onto the gladiatorial arena known as ""the bar,"" has a curved wooden ceiling that looms over you and provides a tunnel-vision view of the world outside the window. It's fun! I like this dungeon aesthetic, this feeling of being underground with no entertainment but good music, fun conversation, and 14 plasma-screen TVs!

But none of that matters. Let's get to the fries!

There are three styles of Housemade & Hand-Cut Tavern Fries, and you know I'll be trying all of them! Each style as a large solo order costs $7.50,  the smaller side baskets that I sampled cost $2.50 each. The baskets and the plates meant to catch the overflowing spuds are the only thing that changes sizes with the separate orders. Either way, you can expect a bit of wait to receive your food, if you haven't waited to be seated already. But that's the way of this ""Pub for Chefs.""

First order of business is the neighborhood style Tennessee Fries. These are the only sweet potatoes offered, but despite the natural flavor they're served with brown sugar, sea salt, and jalapeno ketchup. These fries were warm, despite extended wait to receive them, and are cut into long thin strips that seem to basket-weave themselves into a pattern that makes it impossible to grab just one. The skins are lightly crisp and the insides are soft, but they are thin compared to other house cut fries. The brown sugar coating is sweeter than the taters and dominates any effect from the salt, but meets its match with the jalapeno ketchup. There's an instant heat to the ketchup that lingers through each bite without changing, so you won't have to worry about any surprise intensity. It's a really well-paired sauce for the sugary sweet fries, and you'll taste both profiles when you mix them together.

Next are the ""Belgian"" fries, with simply sea salt and a garlic aioli sauce. I think this is where the ""concept"" starts to unravel, since calling french fries Belgian does not automatically make them so. Sea salt is good and powerful even as a simple seasoning, and although I'm not a fan of aioli the sauce was acceptable. But these are some chewy fries. They're hand-cut to leave the natural skins on, but those skins aren't crispy, and neither are the insides, which only become soggier with time. To be Belgian style, fries have to be cooked twice in oil, with resting time allotted between dips. These fries are just twice as oily, with no notable inherent flavor. What appears to be more important to the corporate planners behind Tavern is the fact that ""Belgian"" looks fancy on the menu.

Finally, a style I've never encountered before: Tuscan fries, with garlic, parmesan cheese, and crushed red pepper. You've probably had garlic and parmesan fries before, and here they're pretty good toppings even though they make the dish wetter but better. The herby scent of garlic masks the cheesy fries as you first taste them, but the peppers come out of nowhere with a bitter hot flavor. Unlike the Tennessee ketchup, this heat is inherent to the fries, and can surprise you if you're not expecting it. Since there are so many layers of flavors mixed on, these fries can get away with being soft and oily, and I'd recommend just going in with a fork anyway instead of shoveling them down by hand. I can't imagine anyone getting through a large order of these though, the side size is plenty!

Final rating for Tennessee fries: 3/5 Spuds.
Final rating for ""Belgian"" fries: 2/5 Spuds.
Final rating for Tuscan fries: 4/5 Spuds.",3.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0,2,4,0,0,0

I should have asked if they do spicy.     either way it was impressive.   she even said to not close the bag too tight to ruin the crisp on the chicken.

318,"My friend and I have been coming to Pickles and Swiss every week since it opened four years ago so I feel bad we never left a review until today, but let me tell you some of the reasons we keep coming back to this place:

1) The service is great! Honestly, everyone is SO friendly and genuinely wants to be there or at least wants their customers to have a great experience. Mark, the owner, truly sets that tone himself. Despite owning the place, he does not feel like making a sandwich is beneath him and I always see him trying to please his customers 24/7. He recognizes me and my friend when we come in, immediately knows our sandwich order, and ultimately makes us feel like we are guests in his home instead of just ordering food at a sandwich shop.

2) The food is beyond amazing! Our go-to sandwich is the Chipotle Turkey Club (on sourdough!) and even though we've ordered other delicious sandwiches (I'm looking at you Pickles&Swiss and All-Day Brunch Dunch), we keep coming back to this sandwich week after week especially when paired with their tomato basil bisque (an original recipe). One time, they ran out of the chipotle aioli on our sandwich but what did they do? They spent time whipping up their own version with sriracha sauce! They could have easily said ""sorry, we ran out"" but they didn't want to disappoint us and went the extra mile. Bravo! Also they don't skimp on the pickle--I see the bucket with the pickles and they take extra care selecting a good pickle and leaving the lame ones. The pickle popcorn is also the greatest thing on earth--sometimes it goes missing making me wonder if someone ran off with the dispenser full of pickle popcorn like I sometimes daydream I'd one day do haha

3) The atmosphere is what seals the deal! The place looks nice, has some fun games while you wait but above all this location has been our sanctuary. My friend is also my colleague and we have some rough days at work and absolutely look forward to our walk from the office--rain or shine--to Pickles and Swiss because we know for the next hour we can unwind, eat some good food and talk. This place holds some of our deepest secrets and bonding sessions and we will forever be grateful to P&S week after week.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5,5,0,0,0,0

I've been in St. Louis for 5 years and just now managed to come to this famous diner since I live in outside of the city.
The interior is bright, light, and clean. It is also much bigger than a transitional diner having 7-8 booths, not including the ""carousel of love"", and tons of counter seating with color changing LED lights, purse hooks, and charging outlets underneath the counter top. Our server was very friendly, helpful, and happy. She was patient, answered our questions  and explained to us everything about the Peacock Carousel of Love. The COL is an 8 person rotating booth that is reservable for $50. Most people use it for special events, get togethers, birthday parties etc. Once seated, the open area of the booth is turned and the booth becomes almost completely private, the staff opens a curtain to reveal a flat screen TV and a PS4 for our use. We are also given a free appetizer of our choice and you are encouraged to relax and spend time in your private booth, it's a very neat experience. 

They also have arcade games in the diner such as ski-ball, pin ball, and a claw machine. 


The Food - severely underrated 
The waffle was nicely cooked.
The syrup was good
Bacon was crispy 
Burger was good

Wow, the execution was way off. Not sure if it was just a bad night. Lines at the door, empty tables. 

We sat at the counter. Food was ok. Sweet potato fries limp. Everything luke warm. 

The kitchen window was a bottle neck. Very bad. Food sat there forever with no one managing the window or delivering to tables. The manager seemed overwhelmed. Some food sat there the entire time we sat there. Ouch.

Many plates were coming back, or handed back, not cooked right,  missing garlic toast , wrong sides on and on.

The cashier was apologizing to everyone.  I don't know what the problem was but it was bad, real  bad.

Long story short the people there were SO rude. And the cake was not nearly as good as the Broad Ripple location, I had the Pink Birthday Cake and I seriously could have made it at home it was extremely disappointing, and the menu DID NOT even display all the cakes that were available?????? So after we ate our cake we went to go get macaroons to go from the to go section, THEN we noticed there were cakes available that weren't even on the menu ???? which I would have 100% rather preferred.

372,"Recently revisited the village pub and I am going to bump it up to 3 stars in consideration of their constantly rotating tap list.

Once again though the food was a disappointment. My girlfriend and I started with Calamari which came in a small portion and then breading was very light colored, usually an indication of being under cooked. This one totally missed the mark and was well below the quality large chain restaurants serve and no where near a mom and pop Italian place. Also the cost was on par with a level you would imagine something tasting good or passable with a large portion size. This is another example of just like the meatloaf in my previous review, if you can't make it good consistently or at all just leave it off the menu.

My girlfriend had a chicken salad that she enjoyed and came in a portion size large enough to take home as a snack later on. Pretty comparable to standard chain restaurant salads and she left pleased with that.

For my meal I had the roast beef sandwich. First off, please don't offer that disgusting cup of oil you try to pass off as Au jus for dipping. It was literally like dipping the sandwich in a heated cup of cooking oil. Take a hint from other local famous roast beef around the city of Philadelphia and just give some beef gravy on the side be it from concentrate or freshly made.

383,"I work nearby and ordered take out for lunch within the first week or two they were open. First, the inside is very nicely done. You can tell the owners spent a lot of time (and money) taking this plain rental space and giving it the appropriate nautical touches. Second the service. The staff here were extremely nice, although there was a bit of confusion with my order resulting in me eventually just pointing out what I wanted on the menu. Turns out I ended up ordering the fried shrimp meal instead of just the lunch sized ""basket"" portion I had intended on. This ""mistake"" was well worth it because the shrimp were delicious and I'm glad that I ended up with the few extra that you get with the meal. Also the fries were super crispy and absolutely perfect. Keep in mind, I took this to-go so the food was still spectacular after steaming off in the styrofoam container. Typically this equals soggy fried food, but somehow magically not with these guys! 

So the food was excellent, the service was excellent, (did I mention I ordered at the counter and waited inside and it only took like 8 minutes) the staff was friendly, the place is very clean, and the themed decor works well. This just leaves one thing left... The menu. 

While of course understandable, the errors it is riddled with are too much to ignore. I realize that this has nothing to do with the food, but when someone is shopping around, especially online, the menu is often where you get your first impression. I'm not going to go through it all but simple things like: ""choice one"" instead of ""choose one"" ""mussel"" instead of ""mussels"" ""no spicy"" instead of just ""mild"" then having the other options called medium and hot, etc. There are commas missing, capitalizations are wrong in places, some things are plural when they shouldn't be, and vice versa. ""Not offer on holidays"" should be ""Not offered on holidays"" or maybe ""Offer not valid on holidays."" I also noticed on a flier or mailer that showed up at the office ""juicy"" was spelled ""juciy."" There's more, but I'm sure that's enough examples to get the point across. 

Bottom line... The fried shrimp and fries I had were excellent, and I'm sure the rest of, at least the fried menu, is as well. My nitpicking the grammar is honestly just me trying to help them make the appropriate adjustments to look more professional, so please don't let that effect your decision. You won't be disappointed.

This morning I ordered a crab cake Benedict, but asked for scrambled eggs instead of poached, addition of sliced tomato on the stack, and regular hollandaise instead of the spicy andouille-infused version on the side.  I also requested goat cheese on the side to add to my grits.  

I know what you're thinking...just order the menu item as it comes.  I'm probably one of those hated customers among the industry, but I'm always pleasant about it.  Sometimes I want a particular flavor combination in my meal, but I actually expected some major screw-up with this request.

ABE blew it out of the water with this order!!!  They met all my requests without a single error, and even bonus added some sliced andouille sausage atop the bene.  This provided the perfect hint of spiciness to the dish without overpowering it in the sauce.  The tomato was actually sliced and served at the bottom of the benedict, under the crab cake and eggs but on top of the muffin, which made it much easier to slice up without destroying the whole benedict form.  All the sides were on the side, and everything was hot and fresh.  

I can't say thank you enough for making my morning today, and doing it in an efficient time and with a smile.  Kudos ABE!",5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,5,5,0,0,0,0

Ordered the lobster bisque soup..which really shouldn't be called soup. It was thick & slimy and the consistency reminded me of a canned mushroom soup. There were a few small pieces of ""lobster meat"" literally around 5 pieces. Mussels with red sauce were just OK. My entree included broiled shrimp, baked potato & broccoli. Shrimp were bland..lacked flavor. Broccoli didn't taste fresh at all..more like bagged  & frozen. My daughter ordered the salmon which again lacked flavor as well. Fries tasted as if an entire can of salt was poured all over them. The food quality is simply subpar...especial for the price. The staff was friendly...in fact a Manager(very young guy) came over several times to ask if we were ok. I feel bad for such bad review.

Our waitress was awesome. Overall the front of house was great. But the kitchen needs some drastic work. It took over 45 min before the apps came out. Spinach dip--cold & chips were super greasy. We asked for another and they didn't even bother to put fresh chips on there. Lame! Calamari was standard diner expectations & delivery. Ahi tuna salad was way overdressed and the salad had been sitting there a while...all the produce was wilted and flat...I guess it was time for some inventory turnover. The salmon was ok. They did cook the Israeli couscous well but the asparagus was over cooked. Tacos were lame even for a diner. The personal pizza was what you'd expect...nothing special.

My server seemed to be troubled because I asked for the table to be cleared of some sticky goo. Once the food did come it was not prepared as per my request. Since it was still eatable I figured just eat it and call it a day. Well,  the idea of being served sausage pink on the inside is not acceptable. I had to send it back to be browned more, or cooked fully. By the time they were brought back to me, not only were they still not done. They arrived once my plate had gotten cold. Now as far as the service is concerned, it was terrible. Not once did she return to the table to check on progress, or concerns. She appeared to be too busy cleaning other tables.

400,"There is no restaurant I have a closer attachment to in Tampa Bay than Pane Rustica. Shortly after graduating college and getting our feet on the ground to  the point where my girlfriend and I could afford to eat at finer dining establishments, we visited Pane - it was the best meal of my life. At one point I even had the menu descriptions of the dishes we had (specials) saved on my computer, as if it was something to be cherished - and for me it was. 

I have always been intrigued by food since a young teenager - but usually I was resigned to whatever was available in the small town I lived, that with few exceptions was nothing special. This was the first place I ate that I experienced flavors that I had seen so many times in the numerous culinary programming I grew up watching on TV. Despite that Pane may have been my first, it has remained reliably one of the best restaurants in Tampa Bay as I have made my way down the list of established and new gastronomic workshops. 

At this point I have had nearly everything on the published menu (time for an update), and while I could dwell on the intricacies of each dish, there is no need, they are all exquisite. I will say though that I believe Pane is at its best when using seafood - but this is not a knock in anyway to their meat entrees. 

There are some restaurants that I greatly enjoy which have obvious shortcomings which I overlook due to the exceptional execution of what they do best - but Pane is solid top to bottom. There is not a selection they offer at which they do not excel. In addition to this, they're large offering of specials is often the best items on the menu on any given night.

Our waitress was honest about the menu, and recommended the St. Charles Benedict instead - fried chicken on eggs benedict (how could you go wrong?!).

The only downside was the wait - which I think could be tremendously improved if seating was organized more efficiently and effectively. For example, we were a party of two, seated at a table for six. And there were plenty of outdoor seats and picnic tables, but those weren't being utilized.

They told us it would be 20 to 30 minute wait. We waited 37 minutes. There were many, many tables open an no one sitting at any of them. They had plenty of people waiting for tables and the wait was very slow. People were walking out. People were asking what was the problem with all the open tables. My family and I waited it out patiently. It seemed that TGI Fridays had not hired enough staff to work at dinner time since we only saw 3 waiters and waitresses. This was already turning out to not look so good. My elder parents were a tad frustrated from the long wait. We finally got a table and wanted to place a order. We came there specifically for the Baby Back Ribs. the waiter told us they were out of them for the night. This was a downfall for us and our experience with TGI Fridays for a Sunday night. They were also out of other items. Not looking good after getting seated now and ordering. The waiter was sick and working because I asked how she was feeling because she did not look well and looked exhausted and tired. I'm assuming she was overwhelmed with the lack of staff and the crowd the 3 waiters had to take care of. She was definitely not happy and perky. We waited a long time for our meal...just about 30 more minutes. My father asked where was our food. The waitress said ""she'd check on it as the kitchen seemed to not be putting food out as quickly as they had in the past visits. The waitress came back with our food and without asking gave us side orders that we did not order or ask for because the kitchen ran out of the particular side orders we ordered from the start. There were items that we did not even eat on a normal bases. We could not understand why she would not ask us first before bringing out our food what other side item we would like until after giving us our entree's. We asked what were the choices and told her what we'd like instead of what the waitress chose. We didn't think it would take long to bring them out. We were just about finished our meal, after 15-20 minutes and the waitress brought out the side items. At this time we were done and would need a to go box. So that was another delay in not enjoying our meal or dine in at TGI Fridays. I ordered the Ribeye since the Ribs were out of stock and asked for it to be cooked medium. The steak was cooked well done and seemed like it was rubbery. Very awful dine in visit at TGI Fridays that night. 

We have ordered to go dinners before and the person that does to go orders always expects a tip without giving the change first. The impression I get is he'd rather keep the change than giving it back first and letting the customer decide if they would like to tip and what amount. If he was ever taught to give change first and in dollar bills instead of five or 10 dollar bills before expecting something in return, he'd probably get more tips. 

I'm giving only 2 stars because I've seen TGI Fridays serve better. I hope TGI Fridays in Metairie, LA improves, with food and having ordered enough, wait times, hiring more people who like to serve customers with a smile for the night crowds they get because we'd like to re-visit.",2.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1,1,0,1,0,0

Beat salad- large and delicious. Well worth it
Deviled eggs- 3 that you will fight over. The hint of bacon is killer
Bone marrow on buttermilk biscuits- light and fluffy with a rich kick. Love in your mouth. Eat up!
Whole branzino- the least exciting of the night. Not a whole fish but a filet with a tail. The grill flavor is the best here and the kale is a massive filler. Compared to the rest, I'll pass on this this.

The timing of the dishes was poor. Our small table for two was filled with a filter water, jug that was rarely touched by the staff, side pates, wine and cocktails glasses and a cup of pop corn. Please stop bring out food. It's getting cold. No really. Every waiter who approached the table seemed to know the menu like they were assigned a section, less one who read off the menu and basically said everything was great.

The Lark is a place to share whether it's with friends in your group or people you just met at large table.

Maybe I'll see you there too. You'll spend $80 for two with a couple of drinks so it's very reasonable. The wine list can set you back another $80 on average or MUCH more. All in good time.

The one thing that they really do well here is their beer list.  Come in and you literally need a menu for the draught list.

The atmosphere also makes it easily the best bar in the UCity area.  You can't beat the roof top patio and the fire places when it's a bit chilly out. The inside can get a bit cramped at night and sometimes is a bit loud with the DJ, but no where near as bad as other near by bars.

If you want to stay around UCity and grab a few beers you can't go wrong with City Tap House.",4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0,3,4,0,0,4

I was in Philly for my anniversary over the summer, and the hotel AND yelp recommended this place for legit beer adventures. And they ABSOLUTELY NAILED IT HOLY HELL THIS PLACE ROCKS.

Great craft beers. Excellent tavern food. Warm bartenders who told my wife she was ""the good kind of pregnant"" and entertaining patrons. I was actually blessed to be there when a kid from tampa attempted to order a bud light, and I watched for the reaction. The bartender didn't explode or get snotty, but politely offered a selection that closely matched the type of lager he was looking for. VERY PROFESSIONAL.

On this visit we sampled one of the Cali bowls, and the chipotle chicken sandwich. This is where I lost my good vibe.

440,"Ate here not too long ago while I went to go visit a friend. I had never been to Anthony's so decided to give it a shot. The first time we ordered from them we got a simple large cheese pizza. That they managed to do fairly right, and despite people saying ""pizza is pizza"" they really do a good job on being generous with the cheese and not leaving the top slathered in grease. Nice for a cheese slice fix. 

However my downside happened when I came the second time and ordered spaghetti. It was fairly cold out and the pizza slice wasn't gonna be enough to hold me over. So my buddy and I decided to get a bite from Anthony's. I chose the spaghetti and the initial presentation of it was standard fair for many pizza/hoagie places - salad, bread, and the spaghetti. Presentation looked decent so I had good hopes for my meal. Paid $11.25 for it. The woman who took my order though was a little snippy, but I took it with a grain of salt. When we got home I opened the lid to discover three very average sized meatballs....

Disappointment. They tasted like they were grocery store freezer brand and just tossed in a pan with some sauce. Bland. No flavor. And the actual pasta didn't do it any justice at all. I could toss some Prego sauce in a pan at home and make better meatballs then this place. The salad wasn't at all all that good,  and if anything looked wilted. How do you mess up salad?

All in all I'll probably be sticking with my local pizza place Angelo's pizza. At least their spaghetti is a large portion, with meatballs covering the entire container, a good sized salad and garlic breadsticks to boot. 

If you come here, just stick with their pizza or sandwiches, which looked decent. Don't go the pasta route unless you really want too. For $11.25 of that price you could go to your nearest grocery and make a brimming pot of spaghetti that will taste better than what this place had to offer.",3.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3,3,0,0,2,0

It's a cute diner. Clean. Everyone was very friendly and the staff was working nonstop. They constantly were checking on everyone on the counter.  It's small so there can be a wait. At 0930 the line was outside. I overheard someone say it was worth the wait!!! 

Going in I knew I had to get the pancakes, hash brown, and biscuits and gravy. It seemed a bit much but I had faith. Got the blueberry pancakes crispy style. Wow!  These were great. This may have been the most blueberries I've seen in my pancakes.  And the crispy style was indeed unique, flavorful, and nice texture. It did seem to already have some butter in it. But I liked it. 

The hash browns were very crispy by not dry!  It was moist on the inside and some of the better ones I've had. 

The biscuits and gravy were also very good. Not too dense. Good amount of sausage (a few more pieces would've been ok too). Gravy was thick. But I do prefer thick vs too thin. Flavor was excellent.

I went with a straight up cheeseburger and a side of fries. You order and then if you're dining in, they give you a number and someone brings your food to you. Mayo and ketchup do not come standard on their burgers so there's a condiment station where you can hook it up the way you like. They serve select wines and beer here as well.

Yes, service was excellent and the decor and atmosphere was perfect, but our entrees were just waaaaay too salty and just seemed of low quality.

As you walk in, the hostess stand in directly in the middle with about 3 people working the desk.  There are 3 floors to the restaurant.  The elevator is located behind the hostess stand.

I had reservations for 5 ladies at 6:45pm and we were seated immediately.  Everyone was nice.  As we walked toward the elevator, the kitchen staff had to stop what they were doing and took a peak at me and my girls.  It was a nice little moment!

Anyways, on to the food.

Apps:
Crab cake - there was more bread crumbs than there was crab.  It came with a light corn maque choux which was good.
Mussels - they were steamed in a savory, buttery and light garlic sauce.  The mussels were plumb, tender and cooked perfectly.
Charbroiled oysters - they were charbroiled in a cast iron skillet that had 6 mini cups to hold the oysters.  The flavor was good, but I was hoping the oyster were still in their shell with the burnt charcoal look and taste.

This is where is gets bad:

Entrees:
Wood oven grilled crusted Drum - the breading/stuffing that came on top of the fish was waaaay too salty.  I just scraped it off and squeezed tons of lemon on it.  The dish came with string beans, pecans, potatoes and bacon...I killed that part of the dish!

Duck - it was tender and juicy, but the fat could have been rendered off a little bit more.  My gf liked it, so that's a plus.

My sis ordered the Drum as I did and she liked it and was okay with the breading on top of the fish.

My other two gfs ordered the Gumbo with Ham Hock and Sausage.  They said that there was no ham hock to be found and the gumbo was waaay too salty.  One gf ordered a side of the roasted potatoes and OMG.....the potatoes were parbroiled in salted water that was waaaaaay too salty.  I think the kitchen accidentally messed that up bc they should not serve something soooo salty....

Dessert:
We were so disappointed with our entrees that we just opted for something that cannot be screwed up - we ordered the creme brulee trio.
It was a vanilla creme brulee, coconut, and coffee.  Dessert came out looking gorgeous and tasted delicious.

The server was super sweet and answered a boat load of questions and was very patient when explaining everything on the menu. The menu is short and sweet with very untraditional for breakfast. The coffee is bold and they even make their own non dairy milk. The chocolate chip cookies are some of the best cookies I've ever had (and I'm no fan of chocolate).

My brother told me this place used to be a convenience store, which is apparent because the acoustics are terrible.  You can still see the fridges that probably used to house Red Bulls or eggs, which is kind of amusing in a diversionary sort of way.  The bathrooms are next to the kitchen's sinks, so it was sort of weird walking by a dishwasher while on my way to facilities.  It had tacky Italian stuff everywhere; in short, it needs more of makeover to hide the convenience store chic.

The place was PACKED for a Tuesday night though, and seems to double as the local Cheers.  Kinda cool.

The food was pizzeria food, with pizza, calzones, and standard pasta/meat combos.  Looks like most of the food was pre-made or pre-bought.  The red sauce was just...not good.  Not terrible.  But not great like a homemade gravy should be. The salad was decent, and the dressing was passable if a bit too acidic.  At least warm up the rolls, guys.

During my first visit, my table of 3 shared the hummus.  Just the right balance of flavor, and served with warm, soft flatbread (pizza crust?), I could easily order it every time I go.  For my main course, I ordered the scallops.  They were large and cooked just perfectly, served atop a heap of creamy butternut squash risotto.  Yum!  Also at my table was the chicken caesar salad (the pretzel croutons were a hit) and the pizza marinara, which my dairy-free pal enjoys every time she eats here.

Tonight, while trying to come up with a place for dinner with the fam that was mostly convenient for my husband and me, and only somewhat convenient for the rest of the people joining our party, I suggested District 611.

Our party of 5+highchair was seated at one of the large booths, but it was a little tight for three adults to squeeze in on one side.  No problem- they added a small 2-top to the end of our table.  Problem solved.

This time, in addition to the hummus (told you), I ordered the warm ricotta with honey and herbs de provence.  It was served with the same delicious flatbread, which had a little extra salt to compensate for the sweetness of the honey.  Oh, and the honey was BRULEED!!  My husband likes to tease me because of my tendency to order anything off a menu that has the words ""ricotta"" or ""honey"" in the description.  Well who's laughing now, suckaaa?  This appetizer was SO GOOD.  My entree this time was the papperdelle in pomodoro with grilled chicken.  All was cooked perfectly, and my side of apple cider brussels sprouts complemented it well.

My Girlfriend and I both used our half price appetizers ticket coupon and walked in with a beer and cider from the center bars at Xfinity Live. My Girlfriend ordered loaded fries she enjoyed and I ordered the nachos. I was not impressed with the nachos. The chips tasted stale and there wasn't much to the nachos.

523,"Plenty of people at work rave about Fresh Kitchen, so I've given it several tries. My problem with the place is its lack of consistency. I've ordered the same items three times now, but while the first time was fantastic, my second two meals left a lot to be desired.

My coworker picked up my meal for me the first time I tried this place. I ordered the sweet potato noodles, the cauliflower mash, the chick peas, and the almond chicken. However, she called me and told me they were out of chick peas, and said I had to choose quickly because there was a line behind her. So I hurriedly said the sweet potatoes, knowing full well I already had the noodles and the mash there -- but I was under pressure. Well it turns out I didn't like the noodles at all, but the sweet potatoes were the best thing I had from that bowl. All in all I was fairly impressed: the mash had a good consistency that didn't scream cauliflower, the chicken was good, and the sweet potatoes were honestly fantastic. I told my coworker we could totally order from here again.

However, I drove to Fresh Kitchen the next time and ordered pretty much the same foods, this time getting the chick peas instead of the noodles. But the sweet potatoes were underdone, the mash had HUGE chunks of cauliflower in it and was much more bland than before, and the chicken tasted like it had been sitting out for hours. My third visit ended up being much like the second.

I'm going to give it another shot and hope for the quality I got from the first meal I had here -- but I know it'll be a gamble.",3.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,4,0,0,0,0

We held our wedding banquet here on Saturday (August 23) and it exceeded our high expectations in every way possible. 

Our meetings with the owner/chef David and manager Apple were attentive, thorough, creative, and effortless. They designed (and revised) the menu until we had what we believed was the right combination of hors d'oevres, wines, and main course. 

The decor is wonderful. The Inn dates back to less than 40 years after the founding of our country. The surveyors Mason and Dixon dined in the very room where our reception was held. 

The menu received raves from every guest: oysters, charcuterie, cheese puffs, crispy chicken, filet mignon, scallops, au gratin potatoes, quinoa and fresh peas, pear salad, white gazpacho. 

The service was impeccable: discreet, attentive, prompt, cordial, efficient, anticipating our every need before we even knew we needed it! One had to barely glance at a wine glass before the staff was there.

571,"After leaving another restaurant because we had bad service, one of the locals recommended we come here. We walked in and we were not greeted at all. We told a hostess we had a party of 6 and she grabbed menus. Another group  walked up and she proceeded to help them before seating us even though we were there and waiting already. We sat down and ordered food and drinks. I had the baked spaghetti and meatballs. The sauce was bland. I took a few bites and left it alone. A couple of people liked their meals enough to eat. The two sprites we ordered were more like carbonated water because the syrup ran out. The server did fix this though. My daughter ordered a hamburger and the server of course asked about cheese, which she did not want. But of course her burger came out with cheese. We sent this back and she ended up barely eating the burger once they brought it back out because she had to wait an extra 20 min for it while everyone else ate. The server just was not very attentive.

Not sure what the issue was. Once someone was there to take out order it's pretty easy everything is ordered by the lb so just go for it. I got the brisket, tri too and ribs along with there smashed potatoes and a drink and it was a little over 30 bucks which isn't bad for 2 people and good BBQ. They bring everything on a huge platter covered in wax paper which is odd but works. They have a  good assortment of sauces for u to try.

592,"Bland, unimaginative food, slow service, and the restaurant lacks the resources to keep the bathrooms clean and working.  At first glance, it looks like a nice restaurant with a clean, modern inside area and an open outside eating area.  

It was freshman move-in night and we went for dinner.  Whether you give the restaurant a pass for it being freshman move-in day, that's your decision, but it's an annual event and you would think that every restaurant and business would be prepared and excited about the annual wave of customers.

Everything started fine and our party of 6 was seated within 5 minutes.  We placed our orders within 15 minutes and then the waiting began.  The waiter kept coming back and apologizing for it being slow and setting our expectations that the kitchen was way behind schedule because of lack of workers.  One hour later, we got finally got an order of onion rings and sweet potato fries delivered.  Then we had to ask the waiter to give us place settings - and he gave us napkins and forks.  Later we would have to ask him to give us knives.  The fried foods were greasy and nothing special.  The greasiness tells you that the food was probably frozen or reheated by tossing back into the fryer.

Now the waiting begins again for our entrees to arrive.  Some of the people at our table ordered salads.  The salads looked good, but there was barely any dressing and the salad dressings were bland and flavorless.  When our entrees arrived, there was nothing notable either positively or negatively about the entrees - I would call them uninspiring.  We had flat bread pizzas, mac and cheese, and a cheesesteak at our table.

Towards the end of the meal I visited the rest rooms.  The rest room was trashed!  There was paper all over the floor.  There was no soap to wash your hands.  The paper towel dispenser was empty and the air hand dryers were not working.  The restaurant obviously knew about the situation because someone had taken the time to put a small pile of the small bar/cocktail napkins by the sink to dry your hands.  I wonder, is that a health code violation to not have soap for kitchen workers to wash their hands before returning to work.

We skipped dessert because it was already past 2 hours for a simple meal and didn't want to wait any longer.  There was another table of 8 near us and they threatened to walk out after waiting so long, but their waiter convinced them to stay longer.  They were still waiting for their food when we left.

BUT, many other restaurants in this price range and below still manage to deliver good food and at least passable service on the weekends.  This place provided neither. 

I had the Eggs Benedict with Pulled Pork and my dining companion had the Waffle Couchon (their take on chicken and waffles but supposedly with pulled pork and a chimichurri sauce).  My benedict was very disappointing.  First, the egg was not poached.  It was fried with no ""runny"" yolk.  There were maybe two bites of edible meat on the dish, with the remaining being a slab of inedible fat.   The cornbread served with this was hard enough to break a window, and flavorless.  This was better than the other dish though.  When my companion ordered the Waffle Couchon he was not informed that the sauce had been 86'd - nor was he ever so informed and given a chance to change his order before it arrived.  After a very long wait when the food was delivered, he tasted the chicken only to find it was very very dry, and flavorless.  So, he requested the sauce and was told there was no more sauce.  After he choked down the dry chicken with the pancake syrup offered as a replacement, some other sauce was brought to the table, but it was too late, the damage had been done.  

The service was also horrific.  Yes, it was Saturday morning but, yet again, many other places in town are able to provide good food and good service even when they're slammed.  This place did not.  When we arrived, we placed our name on the list outside.  When we did, we were #3 on the list.  However, 15-20 minutes after we had done so, we kept seeing people come in after us, not put their name on the list and be seated.  We ended up sitting at the bar where it was very crowded, as it's apparently also used as the waitstaff's serving station.

Today was the lunch from hell.
It wasn't crowded but it took forever to take our drink orders. We waited for an interminable time only to get one wrong.

617,"I was pretty excited to finally get a Pizza Hut in the Santa Barbara area, but upon my first visit, I was sadly disappointed. I placed an online order, which is pretty difficult to mess up, but they managed to. I didn't go for any of their fancy new additions like the new crusts, sauces, drizzles, etc. but given this experience, I'm not confident they could even handle any of those. I simply ordered a meat lovers pizza with extra sauce, and the amount of sauce on my pizza was pathetic. It seemed like even less sauce than normal. Not only that, but the pizza just wasn't good. After a couple bites, I decided to forego eating the pizza altogether, and found a homeless man to give it to. Meanwhile, I was starving but went to Woodstocks and waited for a pizza actually worthwhile. 

In addition to the poor quality, the service also wasn't great. The pizza was nearly cold and the girl working there was kind of rude and basically suggested leaving a tip...for a take out order. When I got back into my car, I saw her ranting to her co-workers about something in rather animated fashion. I'm not conceited enough to think it had anything to do with me, especially since I was friendly and raised no issues, despite lacking customer service. However, it just didn't seem professional to me. Granted, how professional could one expect someone who works at Pizza Hut to be, but still.

The utilitarian kitchen is located in the middle of the restaurant where it seemed out of place. In nice weather, you can sit outside (best option). Otherwise, I suggest sitting upstairs, where it's a little quieter. 

Service was pretty limited. For example, our waitress who was quite friendly, opened the bottles of water we ordered and sat them on the table. We had to pour our own water. Ditto for the wine we brought. While they uncorked it without a fuss, we then had to ask for glasses, and once those were plunked down on the table, ended up pouring the wine ourselves. I had to ask for a knife when my entrée came. Although the staff was pleasant, it often felt as if we were at a self-serve diner. 

Food was passable, and the focus seemed to be very firmly on quantity over quality. Portions were truly ginormous! We opted for the arugula salad as an appetizer, and the penne a la vodka and a vegetable bowl with edamame and tofu over spaghetti squash for entrees. The arugula wasn't fresh! Blech! The vegetable bowl was surprisingly tasty, with nice hints of ginger coming through. Unfortunately, it was drowning in a large, deep swimming pool of  teriyaki sauce, which completely overpowered most of the other flavors in the dish. The massive bowl of penne a la vodka was bland although edible. 

Desserts were huge and very sugary. Biggest cake slice I had ever seen! Ditto for the creme brulee dish.

Not a horrible place if you are starving and just want to leave stuffed. Even then, there are far better options on either side of the bridge.",2.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2,3,0,2,3,0

I came here a second round and had the fried mac n cheese, which turned out a bit dry on the inside.  To top it off, the double cheese burger pizza was a let down.  The sweet potato fries were burnt to black and the pizza was dry.  It was not moist at all.",2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0,3,0,0,0,0
620,"This was an awful experience. I wish I could give ZERO stars. 

Let's start with the positive. 

We were sat immediately. Our server was nice.

Now onto the bad and worse:

The restaurant was absolutely dead and not busy whatsoever. This will play a part later in the review. So we order and all I asked was for non-breaded chicken and no flour or anything just baked chick tenders with sauce, pretty simple right? I also ordered a salad.

Literally, 30 minutes later after our order was take with not really anyone in the restaurant I finally get my salad. I also had to ask for it up front because I was starving.

Another 7~10 min later we get our food. Roughly 40 min total. So here is where it gets worse. Chicken tasted like rubber and the sauce was awful. Nothing special about the sauce at all. The salad was better then the chicken. Do the nice waitress comes over and asks how everything is. So I tell her the truth. She is shocked. So she initiated to engage her manager, which I didn't care I was just hungry and I finished my food and I wasn't asking for anything. She still went and told the manager at the time. So she comes back and says sorry we will take it off the bill. I didn't ask but ok. I'm so pissed off the manager doesn't have the decency to come and talk to me and has the server deal with it. That is absolutely piss poor leadership and management. No matter if you are at McDonald or a high end steakhouse. It doesn't matter, just support your employee and make it right for your customer. I don't even care about them taking it off the bill I ate my food. Your employees and customers deserve better. 

My friends food also had no taste, he just didn't say anything because he wanted to be nice I'm just choosing the truth. Fix this!!!

I feel a little guilty reviewing, since I only experienced their takeout beer and not their food or service, but I feel the need to rant a bit. This cafe was opened by the people who run Bella Vista Beer Distributor, so, as you can imagine, their selection is pretty expansive. However, they don't give you a discount for takeout beer. Normally, the price of a takeout bottle is 40% off the bar price; since you're not drinking it at the bar, you don't have to pay the bar tax. Apparently, the people running Hawthorne want you to pay them the bar tax simply for selling you the beer.

Moreover, the growler prices are astronomical. They want $33.50 for a growler of the Founder's IPA (not including the glass, which will run you an extra $15). A growler is not even a six-pack's worth of beer!! I wouldn't ever consider paying $33.50 for a six-pack. I could just go to the Devil's Den (during normal hours) and order six pints for less money... or, better yet, buy a case of beer! I just don't understand what their deal is. Sorry for the rant, but I just came home with three 12-ounce bottles of beer for $17.50 and I am steaming. The prices of their single bottles aren't marked, so if you decide to go in there, just be careful. Rant over.",2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,2,0,0,2,0

For those of you who are huge Saturday brunch fans (raises hand), this is great, because the number of restaurants that offer Saturday brunch with unlimited mimosas in the Tampa Bay area is rather limited (I'm looking at you World of Beer who only offers brunch on Sunday).

The great thing about going here is you can order off their brunch menu or their regular menu. My husband is not a huge brunch person, so being able to get wings at 11 a.m. is a huge boon to him. On the other hand, I love brunch. I got the vegetarian omelet. The menu online says it comes with tater tots. I figured oh well, I won't be healthy, my hands are tied, but in the restaurant it comes with fresh fruit. It made me feel a tad guilty switching that fresh fruit to tater tots, but when I chomped down on that crispy, salty, goodness the guilt dissipated. Do yourself a favor and get the tots. It also comes with buttered multigrain bread. As far as the omelet goes, have you ever really had an amazing or disgusting omelet? Ok, yes I know it is possible, but most omelets taste like an omelet. It's hard to mess up. My friend didn't like her egg white omelet, but I thought mine was fine.

Service was on the slow side, which is surprising because they weren't that busy. When you have unlimited mimosas, you expect your glass to always be full. I'm a slow drinker, so mine was, but that's only because I was with quick drinkers. They had empty glasses about 1/3 of the time and mine just kept getting refilled when the server came over to refill their glass.

Overall I think this is a solid Saturday, bottomless mimosa brunch place.",4.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,0,5,0,0,5,5
662,"Texas Roadhouse in Royersford is a weekly pick for my family. The wait staff is always friendly and helpful. They give off the impression that they really want you to enjoy your time spent there. The food is always delicious and flavorful. Only once out of the many, many times that I've dined there, was 1 of my sides brought out wrong. So, in my experience they have a 99.9% accuracy rate.

I've never had a bad dish at Roadhouse. I highly recommend trying their award winning ribs, which are truly fall off the bone. No need to worry about dirtying your hands on this meal. You can literally pull the meat off with your fork. The bbq sauce has a nice, sassy flavor to it. Also, the chicken fried chicken with white gravy is an inexpensive dish and definitely yummy.

The salads are always crisp and the most fresh tasting I have ever had anywhere. And a plus for me, I don't have to pick one thing out of their house salad. (I'm a VERY picky eater) Fresh iceberg, chopped tomatoes, hard boiled eggs, shredded cheese--a must have salad. A little tip-you can save yourself the $3 or $4 on this salad, if you get it as one your sides. If you get it as a side choice, it's the same size as ordering it as a separate item.

You can also pick out a larger steak before they seat you at your table. The steaks are grilled to perfection, whatever your choosing (rare, medium, well, etc.). The flavor is good enough you don't even need A1.

Another recommended choice from their appetizer selections would be the rattlesnake bites. A bit like a jalapeno popper, but sooo much better. So delicious! Or you can try their combo platter which comes with chicken fingers, potato skins, and rattlesnake bites and your choice of 3 dipping sauces.

Some other info: For parents, they do have a children's night once a week (Tuesday, I think??) and they offer a 2 meals for $20 deal from 4-6 P.M. at least Mon-Thur, maybe Friday too (not sure on that one).

Now to be fair, there are a few cons. They don't open until late during the week. So you can't go there for lunch. Even though this one attests to their good standing, it's still a con for some people. Depending on what time you go, the wait time can get ridiculous. However, they do have call ahead seating so really I guess this one isn't so bad if you remember to grab the number or have it in your phone or something for those spur of the moment times you want to head over and don't want to wait for a table. This place is ALWAYS packed, but it does show they really are that good.

All in all, I've been a customer of this establishment since it's opening and not once over the past few years have I had a bad experience or meal here. The best part, you don't need to like country music to enjoy your visit.  ;)",5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,3.0,5.0,0.0,5,5,0,0,0,5
663,"I was here right around Christmas with my dad.  We had been shopping at Barnes and Noble for quite awhile and got hungry.

I have only been to a Red Robin one other time which was in July of 2009 in Missouri...  

On this visit, it was pretty crowded, but I don't think we had to wait more than maybe ten minutes.  I like that they have vegetarian as well as vegan burger options, but dislike the GMO brands that they use.  My Boca burger was pretty decent, but I think I might opt for a salad if I go back.  I liked the pickle, lettuce, and tomato.  The fries were better than most fries elsewhere, and I had plenty to eat, but they did not ask us if we wanted a refill on them.

Our server was pretty good for the most part.  She was friendly, but disappeared a lot.  They WERE slammed, so I tried to give her some slack on that.  The only thing was that the beer I ordered didn't arrive until we were almost done eating so I pretty much had to down it and couldn't just enjoy it.  She blamed it on the bar.  I'm not sure if that was just a line or if it really was the bartender, but either way, it was a draft Stella Artois so how hard can it be?  I got a glimpse of the bartender on our way out.  She did look to be struggling a bit, but the bar was a lot less busy than the tables.  People have bad days and get sidetracked, but when I was in the same job,  this wouldn't have happened.

Dad had a Coke, I believe, and the price seemed pretty high for a fountain drink.  Some of the mixed drinks and specialty lemonades on their beverage menu seemed overpriced as well.  They did have a club with some benefits we signed up for, but I think my dad and sister had some sort of problems with that a month or two later at another location up north...

Overall, the atmosphere is nice and known for being kitschy.  My dad pointed out the portrait of George Costanza over the restroom entrance.  The noise level wasn't too extreme for being so full and I like the dim lighting.  There was a birthday or two going on and a lot of kids in there, but nothing too wild.  I don't especially like chains, but I might go back if I am back in the area.  I like Plainfield a lot more than most parts of Indy and it's closer to home.  I'd give more stars if I didn't have to wait so long for my beer.  I probably should have asked them to take it off the bill.

664,"We chose to eat here because it was right by our hotel without reading any reviews. From the beginning the service was very slow. It took about 5 minutes for anyone to take our drink order and then when she took our order it took her another 10 minutes to bring it to us. Thank goodness we never needed refills or that would have been another hassle. As for the food, it was just OK. Definitely not worth the wait. My friend's food came out cold.

Before we received our check, the table next to us had a simple problem on their bill. Instead of acting professional, the waitress was gone for 20 minutes ""trying to go back into the system to fix the problem."" The table asked to speak to the manager and instead of being reasonable, she stood there and defended the waitress of why it was taking her so long, COMPLETELY disregarding the customer's concerns of just wanting cash back to make it easier than having to go back into the system. 

So when our bill came I wasn't surprised that it was on one check after we had previously told her to put it on separate checks. When we gave her BOTH our cards, we then reminded her to split it AGAIN. Sure enough, she comes back to the table saying that she accidentally put it on one card and could not go back into the system to correct it. Since we had just witnessed what went on at the table next to us, we decided it wasn't worth the argument to be made fools of from the manager. 

After reading previous reviews, I see that the manager likes to respond to the negative ones attempting to justify the situation. I don't think there is ANY excuse for having bad customer service. What happened to the saying that the customer is always right?? I worked in the restaurant business in college at a much more popular place so I DO KNOW how it is.

The last time I ordered from here, we called ahead and placed about 6 different orders and surprisingly the employee was fine with us placing so many different ones and there was no confusion as of whose was whose at pick up time. We opted to take out because although they have seating, there's not very many seats and its small inside. 

We ordered 3 bbq chicken meals with french fries and baked beans, and 1 baby back ribs combo and 2 chicken and ribs combo meals. The food boxes were so heavy and you can smell the aromas while taking the boxes to the car. Our mouths were watering as we drove about 20 minutes home to finally enjoy our meals. 

Everyone was chomping down on their meals and were raving about how tasty they were. I had the ribs and chicken combo and the meat tasted so fresh, the bbq sauce on top was so flavorful as well. I had a side of cole slaw and onion rings which were so tasty as well.

My date had the steak which comes with a killer marinade and was perfectly cooked and juicy. I was delighted with my scallops but the steak was so good! I wish they would do a surf and turf!

Eater beware this is a SYSCO food joint.  

  Went with the wife to grab some grub and we've always driven by only to find a line out the door.  Finally we catch it when it was not busy.  We ordered the chips and queso, Roasted Pear Salad for me and Half rack of ribs for the wife.
  The chips for the queso were stale and definitely mass produced and we kept commenting that we had been having much better and fresher chips at a few other locations recently.  When our food arrived, the wife's caesar salad that came with the ribs were absolutely flavorless.  How can you not have flavor on a caesar?  Just add pepper ya dummies.  
   My Roasted pear salad which I thought I would get some nice chunks of pear with it only had 4 wispy tiny pieces of canned roasted pear.  I said ok I can deal with it until half way through the salad I bite into a rotten cherry tomato.  No more dinner for me.
  The wife was tortured by her lukewarm microwaved ribs.  Thats right you read microwaved.  We can certainly tell the difference between the effort put forth on a grill  to something that comes from a frozen bag.  Especially when we get our food 10 minutes after ordering.

The dining room is pretty clean, you know like when a place that's recently opened has a lot of staff and everyone is wiping mysterious things off pretend items.  Still, no one's thought about wiping the dusty divider wall between the booths.  There were at least 8 staff working there around 10 pm and three or four couples eating and yet, our fries were cold when served and after we sent them back, we knew they'd been double-dipped in the fryer.  Most of the soggy fries had dark spots on them; they may have been fresh potato since they had a bit of potato peel on them, but honestly, the frozen French fries at El Cap (just down the street) are a zillion times better. 

Prices are affordable If bland food is okay with you; but for a place that serves chicken you'd think that the chicken would actually be good.  The breading has some flavor, but the chicken itself is either salty or tasteless.  They may want to consider brining or marinating it before frying it.  The dipping sauces were equally bad, including the signature blueberry vinaigrette. Blueberry coleslaw is a crime against blueberries.
 
The salad was refrigerator cold, so cold that it was not pleasant to eat. My friend had the 3 tenders and felt that McDonald's mechanically-separated nuggets probably had more flavor.

The dining room is kept freezing cold so that the staff handling the fryers could be comfortable, but sitting outside would have meant sitting under misters near the street.

There was a guy in a chef's jacket, inexplicable for such an establishment, and I tried willing him over with my eyes so that I could complain in person, but he jibber-jabbered with a friend for a good 20 minutes and then turned away to handle more important chef matters in the back where another person emptied an industrial-sized can of goo into another container.  Maybe it was too much to hope for since it's just a glorified fast-food joint, but if someone sends food back the least the chef-jacketed guy can do is come to ask if everything was satisfactory.

One thing I don't think could be my fault is being disappointed by the purple potatoes. They taste and look a little like ground? Like I used to want to eat healthy until I saw those potatoes. I tried to mask them with ketchup only to find the ketchup was some healthy off-brand too, so now I'm out here stranded with purple potatoes in Bloody Mary sauce, wet eggs and leeks, and a $100 bill.

We were seated in the dining area and immediately informed of (at least four items on the menu that were ""86'd"")). We ordered house wine in a carafe for $21 that was not very good at all.  I picked an appetizer which(after checking again) was sold out, also. My Girlfriend picked an entree (which after checking Again - yes again) was now sold out. We were hungry and finally received a slice of bread each and some olive oil (about 20 mins into the meal).
 Everything was ""ala carte"".. A simple salad  was quite pricey. My Gfriend got a pasta dish which was a skinny dish with approx. 8 - 10 Raviolis). I settled on a burger which was not bad. We ordered creme brulee and bread pudding which were rather small portions but tasted good. I felt that they were expensive for what you received. 

Also, we were sat near the kitchen and the walls were quite dirty around the kitchen entrance. The ceiling tiles above were dingy and the place just looked outdated. I felt like I was eating @ an old diner.I spent over $120 in there and left hungry and dissatisfied.

704,"I like this place, I do. The price is perfect for those not looking to do wallet damage on a quick lunch break, it's really convenient to both my weekday full time job and part-time weekend job, and the menu options are pretty much endless. I don't want three stars to scream ""it's just middle of the road"" because it's not if I could lean a little higher in the 3.5 range I would, to me it's literally the definition of A-Ok, not bad but not terrific.

I went in armed with the knowledge that these are big beefy hot dogs and offerings of other assorted types of sausage, also that the dogs here are boiled instead of grilled. I already know that my preference is a thin dog of the New York streetside variety, and I also know that I generally prefer a hot dog to be grilled; I wanted to give this its fair shot though and so on my lunch break over the weekend I headed over.

There are a ton of predetermined concoctions with a single dog running in the $3-4 area while the combo is somewhere in the $6-8 area, perfect for the wallet watchers. Many reviews talk about the Adonis which looked interesting enough, but I last minute decided to go with a ""California Dreamin'""...a dog topped with avocado, tomato, and a lemon mustard vinaigrette. I went for the gold and made it a combo with fries and a malt vinegar aioli and a soda rounding out my total to less than $8. A trip to the in-house ATM remedied the fact that this is a cash only establishment and I took my to-go order back to work.

First thing I noticed, a mixed up soda order. While not a deal breaker, I was really hoping for that Dr. Pepper over the Root Beer...when you drink soda as infrequently as I do, these little treats and subsequent mishaps can make a heart sad. Second, the fries are pretty decent...certainly a dippable fry that can withstand a drag through a hefty dipping sauce, but nothing terribly exciting. Third, the hot dog itself? Well, you can't always sway a girl with a love for the grill, I wanted to love it but it was almost too meaty for a hot dog....is that possible? The avocado was nice and fresh, the tomato mixed in was a nice guac-like combination, but it seemed the lemon mustard dressing got a little lost. The presentation was nice, the gentleman at the counter (possibly the owner?) was very proud of the work that went into the dog as he made it a point to show me before closing up the box. Really nice employees, but in the end that didn't really salvage the so-so(ness) of my lunch.

Maybe I should have gone with the Adonis, maybe the lamb and chicken sausage is where it's at. For the price, I wouldn't mind giving it another shot, there are a number of sausage and veg friendly options that I can see myself venturing towards, I just don't think these are the hot dogs for me.",3.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0,5,0,0,5,5

As we proceeded to try to eat .
our steak we kept cutting off fat! The worst steak I have ever eaten in any place! We called the server over and explain to him it was under 39th Anniversary, I myself did not want to ruin it for my husband that worked so hard to make me happy and feel loved on our special day! I said very calmly to the server and showed him the fat in our napkins as well on our plates!  He said he would be right back. To my surprise he wouldn't give us a name who he talked to. He said he reported it to whoever and told them about the fat that he saw. The server told us that they apologize for it! We couldn't evev finish eating our dinner! We proceeded to try to talk to the server nicely. He came up with well I didn't tell them which table it was so you won't get embarrassed! Really who says and does this? I myself did not want to make a scene in the restaurant do to my husband look very sad that he brought me to the place I've always wanted to go and that was my first time going to make me happy and proud and loved. It turn to be a disaster!! Instead of going looking for management...I decided or I should say we decided just leave and not tell anyone that that place is worth to eat at! We just left the restaurant. Several of our friends and family asked, how our dinner was for our Anniversary. I was not going to lie to them. I told them everything! And they were surprised and they decided not to take the chance to go there to eat. As well as I'm assuming they probably told others . I know I should never assume! I will never ! never! Recommended this place to eat! I will go somewhere else and spend hundred plus dollars to eat like my husband I love doing..this Restaurant will always be out of the picture for us and family to have a dinner! My point is why couldn't somebody other than the server, come over and talk to us about our steak and see what we have on our plates and in our napkins that's all I wanted. If you decide to eat at Ruth Chris watch what you order. We may have just gotten a bad steak! I don't know because I'm never going back! Now several months down the road it'll be my 40th anniversary.

I ordered the she crab soup. It tasted a little funky and was not as good as cream of crab soup that I'm used to and there was still crab shells in it. I ordered their ""philly favorite"" burger the second coming burger that was $15, it was way overpriced. The flavor of the burger itself was decent but the chopped tomatoes they put on it did not compliment the burger. I felt like the burger needed something else to it, and the roll was very greasy. My stomach also began to hurt as I was eating, and then I got heartburn/ acid reflux. I forced myself to finish my burger because it was so expensive, even though I felt like I wanted to throw up. My husband was not impressed with his either and it made him have to go to the bathroom all night. 

Like I said before, anytime I see the word ""famous"" or ""favorite"" or  ""special"" now, I think I'm just gonna consider that meaning overpriced, overated, and just order a different option instead. I knew I should have ordered the pour house deluxe burger instead. My friend told me she ordered that burger at PJ whelihan's and it was really good, but they took it off the menu.

Fried chicken pieces coated in Thai chili sauce and funnel cake fries dusted in powdered sugar served with a side of sweet corn sauce and two small wheels of corn on the cob as garnish. Everything on this plate was awesome down to the corn garnish (yep ate that too!). It's a great twist on chicken and waffles and come on who doesn't like funnel cake???

It's cavatappi pasta tossed with Parmesan, Monterey jack, cheddar, smoked mozzarella and brie cheese. You can get it plain, with chicken, pulled pork or bacon. When they add the meat to it they don't just plop it on top they actually mix it all in and I loved that. It was served with delicious garlic bread.

I appreciate the convenience of their locations outside of the quarter, their hole-in-the-wall vibe that I dig for my morning coffee and breakfast, and that menu prices are reasonable. After hitting a number of pricier places during our stay in town, it's good to have a low-key, reasonable priced option when you just want to tuck into a hot breakfast and coffee. That being said, it's a meal, not a destination. Pretty much everything on the menu is a Waffle House clone, from the pancakes to the hash browns. Their biscuits taste homemade, but the pancakes are straight from a mix, thin, and somewhat rubbery. I need my coffee in the morning and was so disappointed to see my only option for cream was artificial non-dairy stuff on the tables. To complete the array of synthetic condiments, the jellies and syrup are all of the artificial variety made from corn syrup, not the real stuff. The butter may actually be butter tho, but I was so bummed about the fake coffee creamer and corn syrup based pancake syrup that I didn't bother to look. They stay packed, so clearly as long as the food tastes ok despite what they're made from, the location is convenient, and funds are running low after eating at other higher quality establishments during a stay, this is good spot to hit when you just need to wake up and get some food in you.

Our waitress was fantastic. Explained the menu, offered suggestions, checked in at the right times but not too often. 
Food was great. I had shrimp that were cooked perfectly. My rice was a little underdone. 

The cons:
Made a reservation for 8:30pm. Arrived at 8:25, to a hostess who simply stared at us. We gave our name for the reservation but the hostess wasn't able to use the iPad until someone came to help her. We were given a buzzer & had to wait for 15 minutes- don't know why we bothered with a reservation. Another hostess came over asking what number our buzzer was because they'd been buzzing us ""for a few minutes."" Our buzzer never buzzed. We were the only ones in the waiting area by this time. Why didn't they ask us sooner?!  Throughout the dinner we swatted at gnats or fruit flies-not sure which. And unfortunately a family with a baby was seated in the booth behind us (I'm fine with babies!!). But they kept him occupied with kid shows with incredibly annoying, LOUD music--also ok keeping kids occupied in a restaurant but not ok with the disregard for other diners. We didn't say anything because we figured at least the child was quiet & content. Why anyone would take a one year old to a 9pm dinner is a mystery to me. I wish our waitress or management has said something to them. We were clearly not the only ones bothered.

757,"Ugh. Was craving a salad after a Saturday AM work-out, but after perusing the menu at Prep and Pastry, I decided to get the poutine. Which is like, the opposite of a salad. Well it's kind of a salad except you substitute greens for french fries, feta cheese for a large layer of melted cheese curds, and balsamic vinaigrette for gravy made from duck fat...

But this poutine was worth every calorie. I've had poutine before in Quebec and while this isn't exactly authentic, it's so delicious that it makes me not care that it's not authentic. There are two interesting twists: bits of pork belly and over-easy eggs, both of which enhance the dish. The fries are freshly cut and perfectly crisp, and the duck fat gravy...  man, I could just take a bath in it. My only complaint is that instead of the cheese curds being separate squeaky little bites, they end up all melted together as one thick layer of cheese under the eggs.

And they serve up quality coffee from Exo, a swift kick in the face for your Saturday morning (that's a good thing, if you can't tell!). They encourage you to get cocktails but I was still suffering a minor hangover from the night before (what's new?) so I abstained.

My friends got the pork belly breakfast sandwich and the Monte Cristo (a savory sandwich with french toast as the bread, yum!) and there were 0 complaints there.

Decor is rustic but also trendy, down to the glassware they use. Service is attentive. Some minor negatives: not enough room in the parking lot for the typical Saturday AM (ended up parking on the street) and a 20 minute wait turned into a ~30 minute wait.

765,"Let's get it out of the way: Sky Blue Cafe is a hipster nightmare. If you're averse to a certain segment of the city, you may be a wee bit uncomfortable here. Walking in, prepare to see plastic glasses of various thickness and color, facial hair of various lengths, jeans tighter than men should ever want to wear, and various other accoutrements of the hipster battle armor. It's true. But if you can get past all of that, you'll discover one of the better breakfasts and lunches in the metro area. For food this good, you can put up with uncombed hair. You can.

I say all this and recognize that my opening moments at the Cafe were rough. I was meeting a friend for lunch and to talk shop and things were unnecessarily tense from the beginning. Because we were there for a late(r) lunch on a Friday, there was no wait and, surprisingly, there were multiple available seating arrangements. Despite this, we were seated in the doorway. It was a particularly cold early spring day and the constant 'whoosh' of frigid air wasn't doing it for me, so I asked if we could move to the center/communal table or to a four top (the ones in the corner were being used by parties of 2).

""I can't move you.""

""Oh? But there's open seating.""

""We have a party coming in that's going to sit there.""

(internally) ""Where's 'there'? The communal table? The four top?"" (externally) ""Oh, so you accept reservations now?""

""No, but a large party is coming in.""

... ""So, it's not first come, first served... ?""

""Ugh. Let me ask.""

I was ready to leave. This entire exchange was an example of doing entirely too much. A new waitress came to greet us and sat us at the communal table. Whereas the former was curt and dagger eyes, this one was smiles and warmth. It made all the difference. I could understand if the dining room was at capacity but there was no need for any of the drama we went through to change seats. In case it wasn't obvious, we were there to spend money. Asking to be comfortable whilst doing so in a room that wasn't full shouldn't have been too much to ask.

Ahem. Had to get that out.

Once we changed seats and waitresses, the dining experience couldn't have been more pleasant. Despite planning on eating breakfast, I was seduced by the promise of the Beastwich. The name is not misleading. This is a massive beast of a sandwich. Come hungry. Come very hungry. Between two pieces of thick bread lay blackened chicken breast, bacon, carmelized onions, spinach, tomato, colby cheese, and hummus. This was a two-hand, take breaks, set it down for a little while sandwich... and I loved every bite. The sandwich came with a choice of side and since I was already clogging my arteries for the day, I decided on the chili cheese tots. Yep. It's true. I'm not embarrassed. In an effort to balance my gluttony, I made my own smoothie with banana, blueberry and strawberry. It came in a large glass and was filled to the top. It, like my sandwich and side, was very satisfying.

Coming to SBC on a weekend in search of food is a f00ls errand. Perhaps even coming here in the morning in the warmer months isn't the smartest of tasks. Definitely don't plan on coming here with a large group. All of the above paths lead to frustration and ruin. But if you can come by yourself or one other (tops) on an off-time, you'll be rewarded with kitsch comfort that will stick to your bones and live in your memory for quite a while. Even in light of the bumpy start, I'd gladly return for more of what the kitchen's putting out and recommend others do so as well.

I most frequently visit for their amazing Sunday brunch deal - unlimited french toast that is hot and fresh every time (not crappy buffet line food that sits there and gets cold) and is less than $4!! The french toast itself is almost always perfect (occasionally the crust is a bit tough for my personal preference but it has never bothered my husband or other people we dined with), and features a nice cinnamon sugar sprinkle. 

The mimosas are a great deal compared to many brunch spots - $3 each for a tall glass and they are usually pretty bubbly, often with a strawberry on the rim (see my picture - these were stiff and the strawberries were gigantic!). They also have a couple of beer options for only a buck if that is more your preference!

I have to caveat this review with the fact that I learned that we were under mandatory evacuation for Hurricane Irma right before we got here for lunch. Therefore, the meal tasted like hopelessness and despair. (I kid, I kid, but it definitely put a damper on this meal!) The fact that this place still gets five stars is a testament to its awesomeness!

Yes, you can spend an arm and a leg at dinner, but at lunch the prices are beyond reasonable! My husband got a personal pizza (which was $11) and I got the lobster roll (at market price it was $21 which was definitely one of the most expensive things on the menu. Everything else was in the $10-$15 range). 

Testament to the service is the fact that I was on my phone for half the meal talking to my dad about booking a flight to Houston (what irony to escape Irma by going to Houston which was just devastated by Harvey) and the waitress never batted an eye about my exceptional rudeness. It didn't even deter her from doing the normal waitress things like checking in on us. 

The lobster roll was overflowing with lobster. The $21 price tag was entirely justifiable. I thought the bun was perfectly buttered and the apple slaw was a great complement. 

I think this place is great for lunch! Best thing is, you can make reservations on Yelp. Definitely do that! We went at 12:45 p.m. and it was moderately full.

Though Lester's isn't exactly the hip place to go on the weekends, it's a great place to enjoy a cheap drink -- they have a late night happy hour on Friday and Saturday nights ($1 off drafts and $4 wells/wines).  Like every other place in the CWE, they have last call around 1-1:15.

We had experienced a lot of places in just that short time there but I have to say I was immediately impressed with the decor inside and the place is HUGE! So yea the wait staff was a little off that day, the one girl was training someone new and the accuracy for the order taking was a little hit and miss but not enough for me to give anything negative. 

I liked the food  I only had the fries but they were good. BF had a the Big ASS tuna and mom had the Ruben sammy and was supposed to get soup but got a salad instead. We did tell the staff about that later but reassured them we didn't need one to go or to make up for it as mom would not have eaten it. 

Overall good food and drinks, I would go back again. I tend to go and check places out despite reviews, since we all have an opinion on what happens on any given day. In conclusion a great experience and I would  go back!",4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,2,4,0,0,0

Today I popped in for Happy Hour (daily from 2-6 and again from 9-lights out) thinking I wanted some Osso Buco Riblets for $5 along with with $1 off excellent draft. I was persuaded by the guy next to me after seeing his big, juicy, capable of a super model sliding around the hood of a white Jag while being sprayed down with water advert, burger. And the winner is the Pearl Street Blues burger with onion, mushrooms and blue cheese. Medium rare as it should be, it's liquid of love requiring multiple wipes from the cotton napkin.

My second brew was a choice pick from Great Divide, their Hercules Double IPA. Not my first time partying with this hulk of hops. Delicious.

Then the hostess handed us a drink menu. Again, we were confused. I then asked if she meant the kitchen had stopped serving food and she said yes. (Maybe say that instead of ""we already had last call,"" as we had no intentions of ordering food anyway.) Next we noticed a nicer table than the two seater that just faces a wall had opened and we asked if we could move to after it was cleaned.  The waitress cleared the table for us, but it was never wiped down. Another bartender approached our table and asked if our order had been taken. My boyfriend had gotten up to see what beers were on draft and so I began to say ""I think my boyfriend is going to do the draft beer and I'll have..."" But before I could order anything the sever was gone to find my boyfriend and sell him a card, never taking my order. Later the waitress came back and took my order. In the mean time my boyfriend used his card to get a 14 oz pour, but it came out maybe 4 oz. Beer and the rest foam. The bartender told him he poured it wrong.

801,"I will save you the trouble: absolutely do not go here for a full meal. The view is awesome and I would be back for drinks and mayyyybe and appetizer, but my food experience was terrible. I'll start with the appetizers we got (not pictured). The baked brie was cold and solid at the core, with only the outsides being warm and gooey like a baked brie should be. The crab cakes we had weren't bad, but they were nothing special either. If I had to do it again, I'd have them bring out more of the sauce that comes on them, as that had pretty good flavor to spice up an otherwise pretty bland crab cake. 

The entrees are where things went from bad to ugly. I can make a steak at home better than what I had prepared for me with the filet mignon, and at a price of $45, the manager should be thrown in jail for theft. No flavor, poor meat quality, and to top it off, the brussel sprouts served on the side were so undercooked that they had a solid crunch to them like you were almost eating it raw. The mashed potatoes were the only thing I rather enjoyed in the meal, and you could even tell that the potatoes had been plated and had been sitting under a heating lamp while my steak was being prepared. We also had the macaroni and cheese as a side dish, and to call it a ""truffle"" mac n cheese is laughable. There was no truffle flavor in this side at all! My girlfriend said her prime rib was ""good"", but I think she was just saying that to be nice because of how much money I was spending on her birthday dinner here.

My biggest gripe is the appalling lack of restaurant options, but Roberts Block is a beacon of hope in what is otherwise a food desert.  Inventive menu, great decor, delicious food, attentive service.  I don't have a bad thing to say about the place.  For the many who say Roberts Block is expensive, they must be dining at fast food joints or not have been to a restaurant in the last decade, as the burger is $10 and most entrees in the low $20s.  This place is operated by the team behind Leila's Bistro, Flora, Forcella-- some of the only other decent restaurants in the area.  Three cheers for this awesome new addition to Glenside!

They have a really impressive selection of craft beers on draft, a quick way to win me over. As for the menu... I don't think there was a single thing on there I wouldn't like to try some day. The friend I was with grew up in Texas and told me this is probably the best barbecue she's had in her life if that tells you anything.

Service was super friendly and appropriately attentive. We split the sampler (two or three meats and two sides) with the pulled pork, ribs, and brisket with onion rings and smoked cheddar fries. I too have had my fair share of barbecue fare and it was just... so perfect. As the older gentleman who raved about it to us outside the door for quite some time said, you don't need teeth to eat the brisket. Onion rings were without a doubt the best I've had, perfectly light batter yet you won't drag the whole onion out of its shell on the first bite.

Ruth's Chris is MAGIC - that 500 degree sizzling steak makes me happy every time. I never thought I would be so lucky as to have one move into Reno. YEAH! 

We went there the first weekend they were open. Friday night - hustle and bustle - but we felt like we were the only patrons in town. They treated us like old favorites - people who come back week after week and tip well. ;-) 

I had called for a reservation and they said they were completely booked, but if we were lucky - we could get a seat at the bar. We felt lucky and got lucky. Two seats at the bar opened up as we entered. 

Cocktails - they have a great list of crafted cocktails, we tried a couple of them and they were SO well balanced and tasty. I would come back just for the Lemon Ginger Drop! LOVE! 

We also brought a bottle of wine from our cellar. It was rather old and needed to be enjoyed soon. They quickly took care of our request to open it and let it breathe. 

Appetizers - we tried the Veal Osso Buco Ravioli - and it was amazing! We shared these and a Chopped Salad - which was also great.. maybe too much red onion in the salad - but I'm not a red onion fan. 

Steak - We decided to share the Porterhouse - Medium Rare. It came to us sizzling and already cut into easily shared pieces. SO YUMMY! 

Sides - we only tried one side - which was the Lyonnaise Potatoes and they were GREAT! 

Desserts - we had to try the Bread Pudding - I thought it was a custardy masterpiece, he thought it wasn't bready enough. You make the call. We also tried the Chocolate Duo - and I have to say the Chocolate Mousse was the best I've ever had. SO GOOD!

For entrees, we chose the spicy nduja & shishito frittata, and the cranberry walnut with gouda & raclette grilled cheese; the frittata was spicy, but topped with a great slaw that helped to neutralize the spiciness. The grilled cheese was incredible as well; from the sharp cheddar to the sweet cranberry flavor, the flavor was perfect.

To share, we ordered the duck fat tater tots. I have never had anything fried in duck fat before, and I did not notice a difference in taste between the duck fat tater tots here and the tater tots I've had fried in vegetable oil. The tots were shared among our group of 9 coworkers, and it was plenty to share. They were not greasy, and they came with 2 dipping sauces: ketchup and chipotle mayo. The mayo is the star of this dish. I liked the presentation of the tots in a cast iron skillet, too. 

We also shared 2 orders of the fried green tomatoes (5 patties in each order). The tomatoes were lightly breaded and fried. They were nothing out-of-this-world, though. If you're ever in the Ann Arbor, MI, area, try the fried green tomato sandwich at Sava's on State Street. 

I opted to get the Southern Fry instead of the main entrees. Catfish, okra, shrimp, and  pickles. The catfish was wonderful, nice and tender. The other fried goods were good, too, but again, nothing out-of-this-world. My coworker got the jambalaya, which looked very hearty and had a deep red broth base. She wasn't very impressed with it. Another coworker ordered the chicken fried chicken, which she shared with another coworker due to the large portion size. The gravy on the chicken was nice and creamy, and the potatoes were as well. 

The atmosphere here is very hip and trendy-wait staff in bow ties and suspenders, white tiling. There were 3 screens showing the Tigers-Rangers game and the Vanderbilt game. The service is slow, though. Each table gets a bottle of water to be poured and refilled as you would like. Unfortunately, the bottles empty fast when you have 5 people at a table. And, finding your server to ask for a refill is difficult as this place is very busy due to its location on Broadway near other tourist attractions.

In times like these that try the souls of patriots, when it is difficult to differentiate between the criminals and the righteous, it is understandable that a subterranean public house would choose ""Sedition"" as its identity.

Yet, the friendly bartender found us with menus in hand. There were good beer choices, but having to return to see the medical staff after lunch, our libations were strictly water. We ordered the Philbano and Beer Braised Brisket sandwiches, and settled in. 

Both were very good, as were the accompanying fries. The ""Philly Cubano"" was made up of smoked Berkshire pork butt, provolone, peach BBQ sauce and pickled long hots, all stuffed into a fresh Parker House roll. Simply put, it was a great pulled pork sammy. The combination of ingredients played well together and it was fun to identify the flavors as they announced themselves to the tongue.  First rate. The brisket was not quite as entertaining, but was tender and slathered in horseradish and coleslaw between the semi spheres of a brioche bun. Satisfying. Both were substantial enough to bring half home.

Everything on the menu looked great and we were told we could order either breakfast or lunch. Everyone opted for breakfast at our table because that's obviously the meal of choice for brunch, or really any meal of the day for that matter.

I got the eggs benedict which was just ok. The hollandaise sauce was very thin and lacked flavor and the ham was thin and chewy. The egg was poached nicely though. Side of fruit was a nice option but had way to much bland melon.

Everyone else seemed to have similar sentiments about their food. Two people got the slinger which was their biscuits and gravy with sausage and cheese. They both said it definitely was not the best biscutis and gravy they had and in fact said the gravy was super bland and some of the biscuits looked burnt. Mixed together with everthing the dish was ok because cheese does save all.

I was also lessed than impressed with the service. Like I said it was very slow so there was a group of waitresses just standing aganist the wall talking and playing on their phones. You think having less to do would make them more attentive but that seemed to be the complete opposite. At one point I literally had to glare over at them and wave my hand just to get our order taken which is absolutely ridiculous.

On the plus side was the bloody mary bar. You pick your vodka and salt rim then are left with a vast array of mixes, toppings, and condiments. It was a bit overwhelming and hard not to overdo it. Though the price was pretty steep and it was a shame that is wasn't unlimited. 

Probably the highlight of this visit was the gooey butter cake. Definitely one of the best I've had. Perfectly moist and gooey and sweet. Makes me wonder how this place is in the evenings as a wine and dessert bar. I'm guessing that it is probablty better suited for that than brunch.

Overall this was an ok experience. I probably won't come back for brunch or lunch again when there are so many better places to go downtown for that but may try again in the evening for a nice dessert and glass of wine.",3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,4.0,3,3,0,0,0,3

The servers were very friendly and helpful. We went on a weekday morning before school and were seated right away. I like the option of I side or outside. Everything looked clean and sanitized. 

The food was reminiscent of a greasy spoon diner, but classed up a notch. There aren't many diners where you can get puff pastry with sausage gravy and a runny egg on top for under $12. 

The kids loved the pancakes and French toast. We got the French toast OMG'd and they were tasty. The corned beef was cooked well and they were generous with the corned beef. Pro tip from our kids. If you ask you can get a blend of juices for the kids meal. Pineapple/ grapefruit was our family favorite. 

The portions are large enough to satisfy without making you waddle out the door with food coma and regret. The prices were around $10 a plate which we felt was reasonable. You can find places to eat for less, but we liked the throw back retro feel without the grease that accompanies the classic diner. Definitely recommend checking this place out.

I had a Juicy Lucy burger. It is advertised as knife and fork burger. It sure is. Very messy but oh my so juicy. The carmelised onions went great with this hunk of beef.  The Bacon Bleu Burger is what Jessica E grazed upon. Here review was just nodding her head and going yum.  She also had some x=rated mudslide milkshake which she raves about.

They had a very good promotion going on for the day. Take a picture of you smooching and post it to Twitter, Facebook or Instagram and tag them in.  Show it to your server and BAM! BOGO burgers. It was fun and and nice surprise when the tab came.

The service was outstanding.  Tracy gets a huge Thanks.  I left my jacket in the booth. As I was returning in the front door to retrieve the manager was going out the back and handing my jacket to Jessica over the little fence for outside dining. Great job Square 1!

The free darts and pool table in the back room are a huge plus, especially because of their magical ability to smooth over any awkward lulls in conversation if you're meeting a bunch of new people at once. Because it's not an incredibly special bar, Ten Stone never gets really crowded, which I actually don't mind because it's a good place to talk amongst a sizeable group of people and still be heard across the table. 

The beer list is pretty decent as well despite the limited happy hour specials. The food is kind of disappointing though. I got a veggie burger from here almost 2 years ago and I remembered it being REALLY good (I eat a ton of veggie burgers, so it's remarkable that the burger was a standout). However, I had it again recently and it was kind of a bummer. Everything on the plate was lukewarm, but while the burger had the texture of an undercooked microwave meal, the fries seemed like they had been cooked properly a while ago and were left sitting around. The waitress was kind of inattentive and I was so hungry, that by the time the food came, I just went with it instead of sending it back. The complete ""meh""-ness of the meal had me wondering if maybe I had had one too many beers that night when the burger was miraculous.

Got home, opened the lid, and I see all wings, no drumsticks.  That's weak sauce in itself.  The weakest sauce came when I bit into the first wing.  Nuclear is mild.   And it's definitely not because I can eat them hot either, they're just weak.  I'd say they were pretty greasy as well.  

They do seem to have some good drink specials if you're on a budget.  And you can bet on horses or dogs as they have races on overhead when you walk in, that could be your cup of tea.

Easily overlooked though. The pizza was very good. Everything tasted fresh. The pizza had a nice crunchy crust and it was thin, just like we prefer. The sauce was spot on! Not too sweet but not overly acidic. Just the right amount of sauce too. My only complaint would be the menu listed basil with the white, it didn't come with it.

I also enjoy the boneless wings here thoroughly. I will even admit that I now crave their wings. You could say I've been here a few times. 

I am a fan of the boneless wing and am not a fan of the super hot. The original hot was too hot for me. However, the mild is just as it is described ""For those who want the flavor, without the fireworks."" It is very flavorful and goes perfect dipped in their ranch. Their fries are not my favorite, but that's because I don't like steak cut fries. My roommates love the regular bone-in wings, the fries and the ranch. They usually order the Lemon Pepper and the Louisianan Rub. 

Like Terence said, this place does take a little longer than you would think. However, this is actually a good thing. They cook the wings once your order them, hand toss them, and serve them up for you.

I had the Kolsch beer and others tried the cocktails and Pilsner - all were incredible.  The bar itself has well dressed bar tenders and all the drinks are written on chalk boards.

When my husband, who has never turned down sweets in his life, tried the cake he took one bite and said he couldn't possible eat another bite because it was the driest cake he had ever had. The cake tasted very old and like it was left uncovered and out for a long time. The icing and cake itself had zero flavor. 

When I called to let the restaurant know, they said they would pull the cake from the line so no one else would be served it and then hung up on me before I could ask for my credit card to be refunded. The prices are too high for the cake to not be edible.

Dry rubbed (ribs can be opted sauced), perfectly smoked, falls off the bone and just plain PHENOMENAL. They also have amazing vinegar slaw (there is a creamy option but I have not tried it) and potato salad. They have $2 bbq taco Tuesdays and the 2nd Sunday of every month they do a seafood boil, (broil?) It's a casual little southside pub with a great back patio and you can play washers while enjoying their patio bar. They also do shuttles to games. I feel I should mention the service.

962,"Ok I'm mixed in my opinions here. I've always had the food to go, and it's been good. We decided to eat in the restaurant today. We got the 30-pack with original, BBQ, and teriyaki, all in boneless. They were out of blue cheese dressing, which is a huge BOO because I love it with my wings. But ranch will do in a pinch. 

The wings were good. I mean... Besides the teriyaki which is my son's favorite for whatever reason- I think that flavor is terrible! I like their fries and the BBQ wings are my favorite. 

So we are just eating our way through all this food and all of a sudden I bite into a BBQ wing and there's a big green weird clump in it. I don't know what this is, I spit out my mouthful before I have a chance to even chew it once I see the green. Upon really close inspection, it looks a little like a piece of artichoke? Imbedded in chicken though? So weird. I still have no idea what it could have been.  

But huge kudos to the manager, whose name my husband cannot remember. My husband brought the offending wing to the front counter and the manager was summoned. He apologized profusely and offered to buy our next meal here. He explained that the boneless wings come pre-breaded and frozen, which makes sense. 

So we will be coming back again. The weird chicken wing was a fluke and he handled it gracefully.",4.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0,5,0,0,0,0

Moving forward, we decided to split two appetizers and one entree between the two of us.  We chose the calamari with red pepper aioli (which she had before and enjoyed), the tuna with cold mango soba noodles, and the aforementioned tofu entree.  The calamari was served with a lettuce salad and tossed in the aioli, which very possibly was a sriracha mayo.  It was tasty, but I'd expect more from a restaurant of this caliber.  The tuna was also delicious and served with a bit of sriracha on the side.   The  chef is really loves that stuff.  I love it too, but not in every dish!

For our entree, the staff was attentive enough to bring me a fresh knife as well as plate the tofu on two separate dishes. The tofu was grilled nicely and the accompanying asparagus, tomatoes, balsamic sauce, and four-mushroom strudel were all very good.  It was a savory, earthy dish (and no sriracha!).

First off, I absolutely love the location! I have always found that little area next to the pioneer center very inviting, especially for places such as Wild Garlic. When I walked in, I was surprised at how many people were present, but excited because I know it's good for the business. Our group had a table off to the side and it was perfect for us. We were joined by a fellow yelper we hadn't met and conversation flowed nicely. 
Michael and the Yelp team were extremely kind and welcoming, answering any questions we had. They did a wonderful job setting up the event. The only downside was that there wasn't enough seating for everyone to sit down at once, so we were all shuffling and switching back and forth while we ate. 
Owner Dean was a pleasure to have at the event and did a wonderful job at hosting and informing the guests of his story of how Wild Garlic came to be. It was thrilling to hear the story of the Honey, because I personally never understood it, but love it! Now, I will enjoy it even more! His staff at Wild Garlic were also very kind and friendly. They did an excellent job of keeping the food stocked and guests happy. The only suggestion there would be perhaps a double-sided serving station and labels on what food was what. 
It was extremely fun having all of the yelp swag on the tables and rummaging through it, we also had the experience of coloring the Wild Garlic logo and it was exciting to see how everyone had a different perspective of it. 
The food was excellent! The garlic knots were definitely my favorite! But, it was wonderful that we got to sample everything: wings, salad, knots, pizza, & paninis. Each item was absolutely delicious!",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,5,5,5,0,0,0
977,"The onion rings. The onion rings. Oh my god, THE ONION RINGS. Nothing can prepare you for these crispy, crunchy, razor-thin, just-greasy-enough little salty pieces of heaven. Even if you aren't normally a fan of onion rings, you have got to try them at least once. And certainly if you're turned off by the usual thick-cut, overly-battered ones that end up falling apart, these will be a revelation to you. Do be advised: the two of us got a large order, because we love onion rings in general, and were sure a small wouldn't be enough to share without resentments. But the basket she brought out was gigantic, and even after freaking out over how amazing they were and being quite gluttonous (they arrived before the poboy), we had barely made a dent. I couldn't bare to let the rest go to waste, so we packed them to go, thinking to recrisp them later in the oven. But when we tried them straight out of the fridge that night, some sort of fried food miracle had apparently occurred - they were even crispier, and possibly even better than before.

And oh yeah, they serve poboys here too ;) We got the 12"" French fry, cheddar cheese, and roast beef gravy poboy to split, and I guess it was because of all the fillings, but that thing was kind of a train wreck - tasty, but I think in the future I'd prefer not to have to eat a bunch of my sandwich in salad form, using a fork to get the fillings from where they'd fallen all over the paper wrapper. Other customers nearby with more modest poboys didn't have this problem, so next time I think I'll leave out the fries (which didn't add anything to write home about, anyway) and have a more manageable experience.",4.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,5,0,0,0,0

I guess the rain was our reprieve because this place was nearly empty. Some peopel at the bar, and a table of the owner's friends in the corner, and us. 

I was impressed with their beer list, and the server (Can't remember her name: blonde, glasses) was awesome, attentive, and gave good reccomendations.

I was admiring a plate of...something...the table behind us had ordered. The server told us it was a special order b/c they were the owner's friends. ""Fried pickles."" My husband and I commented on how good they looked and smelled and we continued drinking our beer. 

5 minutes later, here comes the chef to our table with our own plate of fried pickles. On the house. They were awesome. Big thick slices of tart pickle with a just-thick-enough golden brown coating. THere was a honey-mustard type sauce that went with them. It tasted very home made to me. 5 stars for the fried pickles and 10 stars for the ""you didn't have to do that"" niceness of the staff.

We got food to go because I believe firmly in judging a restaurant's food by its reheatability :) I got the lamb sliders. He got the cheeseburger.

The lamb sliders were perfectly cooked. I know sliders...and you tend to either get a raw meatball on a bun, or a hockey puck. These were perfectly charred on the outside and nice and pink inside. The buns were tasty and golden brown. The fries were good and the burger...well, let's say I wish my stomach could hold twice its capacity.

Here's what we got from their HH menu:
Smoked chicken tacos - very good seasoning but chicken was very very dry
Local tomato salad - not bad but nothing special. good size though
Boundary Burger - average burger
one-buck oysters - this alone I would give 5 stars. It was very fresh and delicious. 
they do have $5/glass for wine which is always nice.

I would give 3 stars for their HH menu but their AMAZING oysters brings it up to 4 stars, otherwise, food was a-Ok.

I would come back again for HH for the oysters + good wine, also It's nice to be able to do HH everywhere in the restaurant not just the bar area. and it was not crowded at all. 

however, they do seem to have very nice menu for dinner / cocktails and I'm a huge seafood fan so I'll be back to update my review on this place again.",4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,0.0,4.0,5.0,4,4,0,0,4,5

Sam's Goleta totals out to a three. Unless you can walk then it's a five since you'll burn off the yummy sandwich on the way back to the office.

Very friendly family serving up great sandwiches made to order. I lean toward a medium #11with cotto salami, mortadella, genoa, capicola and provolone. 

Service with a big smile while the TV is usually on soccer 
On a business lunch, enjoy a very limited selection of beer in the bottle.
Parking in the back is limited and full at lunch. I usually double park and run in. 

My advice is to get Sam's To Go and roll to the beach. Relax with your good food and enjoy life. You deserve it.",3.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,5,5,0,0,0,5
