# Pilot Testing

pilot_testing_for_topic_modeling.ipynb:   
This notebook contains code that we developed to explore LDA topic modeling and try if it could be used to extract attributes/common topics from the reviews which we planned to use for labeling in the next step.


Dataset_Merging_exploration.ipynb: 
This notebook contains the code that was used to load all 7 million reviews from the Yelp Dataset into a single Pandas Dataframe. Prior to this approach, we were unable to properly create and maintain an instance of a jupyter notebook that could load and operate on all of these reviews at once. 
This notebook also explores some of the attributes of the reviews based on the business metadata, such as location and listed category.
